130,Oh!,Ow!
131,I'm outta here.,"Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you."
132,Really?,"Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up."

224,,"Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots."
225,That's not a question.,"But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease."
226,The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.,The balloon?
227,"Oh, I gotta get my ticket!","Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key."

248,"Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.","Wow, that's, uh, dirty."
249,,"Hey, kids..."
250,"Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!",Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?
251,,"There y'go, kids."
252,And then the peacock bit me. Please kiss me at midnight.,You seen Sandy?
253,And the moment of joy is upon us.,Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
254,So I'm kissing everyone?,"Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother."
255,"Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!",Alrightalrightalright. There.
256,"Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.",I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
257,"No way, forget it.","C'mon, she's your mom!"
258,,Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.
259,"Hey, is Chandler here?",Yeah.
260,"Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell... Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?",Right. No big deal.
261,Okay.,In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
262,What code?,"You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!"
263,"Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.","Yeah, well, you don't have your racket."
264,"No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.","Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size."
265,"Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.","Ross, how could you let this happen?"
266,"I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's...",You don't think my mom's sexy?
267,Well... not in the same way...,"I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?"
268,"Well, not playing raquetball!",He forgot to leave his grip size!
269,,So are you gonna tell him?
270,Why would I tell him?,"How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might."
271,What are you guys doing here?,Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
272,You knew about this?,"Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing."
273,"I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!","Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened."
274,Chandler-,"Me neither, y'know what-"
275,I'm still mad at you for not telling me.,What are you mad at me for?!
276,You gotta let me slam the door!,"Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! See what happens when you break the code?"
277,Joey-,Ah! Huh?
278,Okay. I am so hot!,"Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout."
279,I cannot believe we're having this conversation.,"C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all."
280,"Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser?",Mother-Kisser... I'll shut up.
281,"Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.","Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything."
282,You're kidding.,"""No, no. He said """"When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"""""""
283,Wow!,"""Then she came back with """"The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?"""""""
284,"""'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say """"When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?""""""",That makes more sense.
285,"So, what's going on now?","I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait."
286,Whaddya see?,"Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!"
287,What's a 'niffle'?,You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
288,,"Ross, did you really read all these baby books?"
289,,"Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? This is your baby. Hi Daddy!"
290,Hello!,How come you don't live with Mommy? How come Mommy lives with that other lady? What's a lesbian?
291,"...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? I could call immigration!","I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands..."
292,,Need a new table.
293,"Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?",That's the rule.
294,"What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!",How'd you get to that?
295,"Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio",You knew about that?
296,"Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.","Ok, ok, How about if we split it?"
297,"What do you mean, like, buy it together?",Yeah
298,You think we're ready for something like that?,Why not?
299,"Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?","Why, are you moving out?"
300,I'm not moving out.,You'd tell me if you were moving out right
301,"Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...","Aw, I know all about Kip!"
302,"It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.","Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?"
303,"Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.",So what's it gonna be?
304,"I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!",Or an uncle...
305,"Oh, right, that's me!","Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on."
306,,"Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!"
307,"Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.",Feminist issue. That's where I went!
308,"Yeah, well...","Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?"
309,That's patio furniture!,"""So what, like people are gonna come in and think, """"Uh-oh, I'm outside again?"""" Of course!"""
310,What about the birds?,"""I don't know, birds just don't say, """"Hello, sit here, eat something."""""""
311,You pick one.,"All right, how about the ladybugs?"
312,"Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!","Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!"
313,"So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?","Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!"
314,"Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.","No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team."
315,"What, now?","Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!"
316,Wha-,Wha-
317,I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!,Hey!
318,"Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!","Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!"
319,One more game?,Oh yeah!

322,"Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now","Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? Did you know this isn't Ma?"
323,Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.,Sure. So how long you been...
324,"Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?",Since then?!
325,"No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been in love?",...I d'know.
326,Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.,You're one to talk.
327,"Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.",Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
328,"Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.","It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. That'd be cool.... This blows!"
329,"Oh, good. Rog is here.",What's the matter with Rog?
330,Hate that guy!,"Night, you guys."

335,We'll go to a hotel.,No you won't.
336,No we won't.,If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
337,You're gonna keep an eye on us?,"That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend."
338,Wow. He's strict.,"Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room."
339,"""C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by """"No thanks, it's late.""""""","Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough."
340,What kinda change?,"Well, either you break it off with Ronni"
341,I can't do that!,Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
342,"Yeah, but this is",I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!
343,"Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?",Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
344,"Well, you're gonna.","I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls..."
345,"Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?","Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking..."
346,"Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?",No.
347,"""No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say """"No thanks, I'm married.""""""",You really think so?
348,Yeah. I really do.,"Thanks, Chandler."
349,,What's the matter with you?!
350,We're sorry.,Ma! What're you doing here?
351,I came to give you this and this.,Oww! Big ring!
352,"Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really.","Hold on, you-you knew?"
353,"""Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. """"I'm sleeping over at my accountant's,"""" I mean, what is that? Please!""","So then how could you I mean, how could you?!"
354,"Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.","Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?"
355,"Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.",I'm...happy...for you?
356,"Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was.","Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want."
357,"I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?",Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.
358,That's sweet. Could I take her?,With this ring? No contest.
359,"So you talked to your dad, huh.","Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today."
360,"So Joey, you okay?","Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes."
361,"Hey, Joey. What's going on?",Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.
362,Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!,Sorry. Wrong boobies.
363,"Oh! ...Hello, dear.","I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you."
364,She lent me an egg once.,You're in!
365,"Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI don't think we need a third...","Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks."
366,An egg?,"""Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, """"Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."""""""
367,,Think it'll work?
368,"Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?","Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes."
369,"Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...","No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend."
370,"Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...","Pathetic mess? I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this."
371,"Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh?",How do I look?
372,"Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.","No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down."
373,Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!,"Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous."
374,"You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.","Good for you. Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?"
375,,We can't do that.
376,What? What can't you do?,"Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?"
377,,"Uh, we might be leaving now."
378,"""Tell me it's """"you and me"""" we.""","She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it."
379,"Ok, you can not do this to me.","You're right, I'm sorry. You're right."
380,"Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?","I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler."
381,"Oh, Joey, look who it is.",Whoa.
382,How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?,I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
383,,"If you don't do it, I will."
384,Coffee.,Thank you.
385,Oh. That WENUS.,So what're you going to do?
386,"Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?","How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free."
387,And he's not speaking metaphorically.,"So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... huh-huh?"
388,"Well, I don't know.... huh-huh.... but I'm hoping huh-huh.","I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal."
389,"OK, try this salmon mousse.",Mmmm. Good.
390,Is it better than the other salmon mousse?,It's creamier.
391,"Yeah, well, is that better?","I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?"
392,Waitressing?,Uh-oh.
393,Um... uh.... vulva.,Vulva?
394,"Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.",Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
395,"Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?",What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
396,Please be kidding.,"Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now."
397,OK. I'm in my apartment...,....yeah... what else?
398,"That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation.","Alright, look, I'll start, OK?"
399,"Joey, please.","Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now."
400,Wow.,"Alright, now you say something."
401,I... ahem... I really don't think so.,"Come on! You like this woman, right?"
402,Yeah.,"You want to see her again, right?"
403,Sure.,"Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!"
404,"OK, turn around. I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.","Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead."
405,"Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.",There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
406,....and....,Say it... say it!
407,Funny story!,You're not going to believe this!
408,It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.,"Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again."
409,Again?,"And again, and again, and again... Hello? And again."
410,Hey!,What a tool!
411,,"So, er... how did it go with Celia?"
412,"Oh, I was unbelievable.","All right, Ross!"

414,"Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...",You cuddled.
415,"Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?","Yeah, where the hell is he?"
416,,"Theres the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?"
417,"""Yeah, um, I was over there, then you said, """"Excuse me, hello Miss,"""" so now Im here.""","No, no... how come you are working here?"

474,About how good your cards were.,Heh... I was bluffing.
475,Oh. Right.,"You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?"
476,"Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt...",...Yeah?
477,"You are way off, pal.","No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her."
478,"OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.","Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand."

495,There was nudity!,I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.

509,"Well, high school was not my favourite time.","I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex."
510,I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty.,"No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is."
511,"Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? I'm right, right?","Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle."

534,,How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
535,How about Joey... Pepponi?,"No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral."
536,,"Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. Which I'm not."
537,Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?,Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.

623,"So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?",What do you mean?
624,,Not following you.
625,"Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!",: That book got me through some tough times.
626,"Oh, no-no-no-no-no....","That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time."
627,"No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?","Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something."
628,H-He's in China!,The country.
629,Well then maybe you shouldn't go.,"He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait."

631,"Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you!","Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn."

634,"Hey, big...",Shhhh!
635,...spender.,She's still asleep.
636,So how'd it go?,"Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?"
637,The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.,"Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!"
638,"Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.","It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level."
639,I didn't know you had another level.,I know! Neither did I!
640,Behind my brother's back? ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.,Seven hundred bucks!
641,"Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?","Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something."
642,"Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?","What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?"
643,"Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?","Um, this?"
644,"That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler. Phoebe. Joey, what up?",What up?!
645,"I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.","Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie, for you."
646,Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?,Needs some clothes altered?
647,"No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.","Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990?"
648,,"You know, I think I was sixteen."
649,"Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?","No-no-no-no-no, I'm not fallin' for that again."
650,At his apartment. Is this juice?,"Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?"
651,"Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.","Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means."
652,"I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.",Can we see her?
653,Yeah.,How're you doing?
654,I'm okay.,"Ooh, that bad, huh?"
655,What?,"Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts."
656,"When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.",You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
657,Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?,What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
658,"I don't know, I don't know.","Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you."
659,"Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? Your tailor is a very bad man!",Frankie? What're you talking about?
660,What?,No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
661,Cupping.,"That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?"
662,"Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?",What? That's not? Oh my God.
663,Okay.,"Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test..."
664,Okay. Okay. Okay.,"I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants."
665,"You know, it's... something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back.","I gotta get one, too."
666,"Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.","Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it."
667,Sure.,"Uh, does it hurt?"
668,"It did at first, but not anymore.",Chandler?
669,As much as he needs.,"Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?"

672,"Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?",Who?
673,Hombre?,What's he doin' in my section?
674,I guess he doesn't know.,"Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'?"
675,Mornin'.,"Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory."
676,"Your territory, huh?",Yeah. Bijan for men?
677,,"Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for... Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee."
678,You bet. Maybe some other time?,"Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? Bijan for men?!"
679,"Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.",What is the big deal?
680,Come on. It doesn't taste bad.,"Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh..."
681,Cantaloupe juice.,Exactly.
682,Howdy.,"Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre."
683,"Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.","Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day."
684,What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.,"I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese."
685,"All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?",Yeah I guess you're right.
686,You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.,I'm gonna do it.
687,,"Mornin'. I said, mornin'."
688,Ready.,"Yeah, I'm ready."
689,"My god, what happened?","These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?"
690,How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?,"Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts."
691,"I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.","You guys are messin' with me, right?"
692,Yeah.,"""That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, """"whoa."""""""
693,"""""""Oh, my, god.""""""","""""""Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"""""""
694,"I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.",Such as?
695,"Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap",Check this out. Can I have this?
696,"""Hey, look at this. """"My Big Book of Grievances.""""""","Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too."

698,He's even kind of cute.,"""""""Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school."""
699,Funniest? Heckles?,That's what it says.
700,Whoa!,What?
701,"Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.","So, you were both dorks. Big deal."
702,"I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?",Have you been here all night?
703,"Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.","Chandler, Heckles was a nut case."
704,"Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.","All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go."
705,"""What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it """"supposably""""?""","Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody."
706,How do you know that? How?,"I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out."
707,"You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?","Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?"
708,"Yeah, I understand.","You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?"
709,You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.,Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.
710,"Oh, my, god!","Geez, look how fat she got."
711,"Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.","Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?"
712,I'll take that.,You want his yearbook?
713,"Takin' that with you, huh?","Oh, yeah."
714,,"This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?"
715,"Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?",I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.
716,"Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?","I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again."
717,You were in a porno?,"Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it."
718,"Yeah, is there a hair on it?",What happens if you flick it?
719,Woah.,Foxy lady.
720,"Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the Capades.",The Ice Capades?
721,Pop it in.,"I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled people."
722,Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.,"Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad fo r the paper tray."
723,Nice work my friend.,"Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. . ."
724,"Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.","Me too, we should get goin'."
725,I got the time to get to know Julie.,I got time.
726,What?,"Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?"
727,"No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.","Here comes the beep, you know what to do."
728,"Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.",Do we need a cake?
729,It's Ross.,All right.
730,"So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?","Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies."
731,"Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?","""Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying """"let's go here, let's go there"""". Like we can afford to go here and there."""
732,"Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.",For Ross.
733,Hey.,Hi.
734,"I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.","If it's not you, this is a horrible story."
735,"Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.","Yeah, someplace nice. How much do you think I can get for my kidney?"
736,"Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!",Cool.
737,"Oh, sorry.","Sorry, sorry."
738,"Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.","What are these, like famous chickens?"
739,And for the gentleman?,"Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?"
740,"Oh, you're right, I'm sorry.",Thank you.
741,"Fine. All right, fine.",Yeah.
742,"Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine.","Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you."
743,"So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?","'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla."
744,Ok.,Yeah.
745,Thank you.,Thanks.
746,Could you be less enthused?,"Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--"
747,Like?,Charity.
748,"If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.","Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel."
749,Me neither.,Me too.
750,Fine.,Fine.
751,,"Come on you guys, one more time."
752,Ok. One.,Nooo.
753,"Yeah, we really missed you guys.","Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid."
754,"It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.",You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
755,I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.,And we don't work hard?
756,I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.,And you feel like we hold you back.
757,Here's your check. That'll be $4.12.,Let me get that. You got five bucks?
758,Can I uh see something?,Cool.
759,"Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat.","Goo, goo, goo, waaah!"
760,That is so funny. Let me see that.,"Are you ok, Ross?"
761,"All right, get your coat, we're going to the hospital.",Is he gonna be ok?
762,I don't think tho.,"What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?"
763,"Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag.","Hat, milk, got it."
764,??? Thro up a thro thro--a thro thro!,Consider it done.
765,You understood that?,"Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue."
766,"You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?","It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby."
767,"No, I got him.","No, seriously."
768,"Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?",You wanna smell him?
769,I assume we're talking about the baby now.,"Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head."
770,I think my uterus just skipped a beat.,What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
771,"That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!","Hey, hey, look at that talent."
772,So what are you guys out doing today?,"Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff."
773,You done?,Yeah.
774,"Oh, there's our stop.",Get outta here. This is our stop too.
775,You guys live around here too?,"Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk."
776,You know it?,"Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?"
777,"Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.","Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again."
778,That's me.,I'm him.
779,Please tell me you know which one is our baby.,"Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks."
780,Ok.,"Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth."
781,Yeah?,Yeah.
782,"Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.",Ahh!
783,What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?,"Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns."
784,"Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?",You got a better idea?
785,"All right, call it in the air.",Heads.
786,Heads it is.,Yes! Whew!
787,We have to assign heads to something.,"Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads."
788,"Hey, he's not crying.",Yes! There's still pie.
789,"I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?","Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today."
790,"Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restraunt, ordered champagne, nice.","The guy still won't put out, huh?"
791,"Look, I, y'know, I don't mind taking it slow, I like him a lot, y'know he's really interesting and he's really sweet and why won't he give it up?","Maybe he, uhh... drives his car on the other side of the road, if ya know what I mean."
792,"No, whad'ya mean? He's not British.",Maybe he's. . . gay.
793,"What? C'mon you guys, I don't care, I have a date tonight.","Woah, woah, woah, you have a date?"
794,"Yeah, Monica's settin' me up.","But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh. . .?"
795,Alright.,You're getting a cat?
796,"So, I figured it out.",What?
797,Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me. It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.,"""Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, """"Excellent butt, great rack."""""""
798,"Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet.","Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him."
799,Hey Joey.,Hey Phoebs.
800,How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?,I can't find the remote. Thank you.
801,"So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did.",And?
802,And we did.,"All right Phoebs, way to go."
803,Yay me.,"So, so how did it happen?"
804,"Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.",And what did he say?
805,"He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.",Wow.
806,"""Yeah, so I said, """"OK, relax please,"""" y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.""","Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea."
807,Um-hum.,This man is my God.
808,"And, uh, and then I kissed her.",Tongue?
809,Yeah.,Cool.
810,There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.,"Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?"
811,There's an ad for a naked chef?,"No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then..."
812,"Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?",You got all that from saline solution?
813,"Ok, all right.","Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses."
814,"Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.","Hey, here's a thought, Ross."
815,Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.,"Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome."
816,"No, Amish boy.","Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first."
817,"I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.",You could say that.
818,I don't know.,"Oh, her ankles are a little chubby."
819,"I'm telling you this thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek?","Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?"
820,"Well, uh.","He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes."
821,Come on.,"Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?"
822,I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.,"Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea."
823,Number six: the way you smell.,"Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?"
824,"Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?","Oh, yeah, I do."
825,"Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.","I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer."
826,"Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you should see the size of his Christmas Balls.",Hey.
827,Hey.,"Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?"
828,And twenty-five it is.,You gave him cookies?
829,"Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.",Oh my God.
830,What?,"Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this."
831,,"I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'."
832,"Um, just some presents.",C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.
833,Wow.,"So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . ."
834,Joey!,"Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!"
835,I hope she's OK.,"Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through."
836,How do you know exactly what she's going through?,She told us.
837,"Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.","Monica, pigeons learn faster that you."
838,,Phoebe here with the cab yet?
839,"Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in.","Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7."
840,"Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time.","Hey, here she comes."
841,Hey.,Hey.
842,Hey.,Hey.
843,Eeeshk.,"Yeah, big stuff."
844,Hey!,Hey.
845,Yeah.,Sure is.
846,Alright.,Good luck Phoebs.
847,OK.,How far'd ya get?
848,Uh-huh.,"Phoebs, what's goin' on?"
849,"No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . .","Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy."
850,"Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.","Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today."
851,"Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.","Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you."
852,"Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out.","Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas."
853,"Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!","Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?"
854,"Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone.","Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope that's alright."
855,,"Rach, these are for you."
856,Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.,"No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do."
857,"Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?",Uh-huh.
858,You guuuyys.,"And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth."
859,And last but not least.,They're ribbed for your pleasure.
860,,"When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff."
861,"Hey, do you need me to pick you up?","No, I'm alright man. Really."
862,"No, I'm picking you up.","Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me... Alright! It still works."
863,Really? I only had two glasses.,I just had a glass.
864,Oooooh.,Ooooooh.
865,"Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was soooo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'","Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?"
866,Hey.,Hey.
867,"OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who.","Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!"
868,What?,With a man?
869,What? What is so strange about me having a date?,"What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?"
870,"Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition?","Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday."
871,"Joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic?",No.
872,"Well, here it is.","OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady..."
873,"Oh, isn't Lori a doll?","Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in."
874,Hey.,Hey.
875,"Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry.","Well, the part's mine if I want it."
876,Oh my God!,"Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady."
877,Oh my... God?,"Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television."
878,"So, what're you gonna do?","Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?"
879,"Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.",I've never slept with someone for a part.
880,Well is she...,Sorry.
881,It's alright. Is she good-looking?,"Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. You know, after having slept with her."
882,"Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.","I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General."
883,Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?,"Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it."
884,I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.,Hey.
885,How'd the callback go?,It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.
886,So what'd you do?,"Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way."
887,Good for you.,"But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part."
888,So... and?,"Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!"
889,Allright!,Alright... I've got to go shower.
890,This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.,"It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives.."
891,"Oh, you are so great! Thank you!",Are you really not going?
892,"Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.","Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever."
893,Did I miss it? Did I miss it?,"No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself."
894,"Whoa, she's pretty.","Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting."
895,What?,"It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this."
896,"Oh, ok.","""There's my scene, there's my scene. """"Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon."""
897,Is she gonna be all right?,I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.
898,That is so good! Do it again!,"""All right, all right. """"Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"""""""
899,Oh god.,I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.
900,Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.,"Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?"
901,"I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.","Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?"
902,None.,They didn't fight a lot?
903,"In my day, divorce was not an option.","Hey, look who's up."
904,"Joey, speed it up!","I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!"
905,,"It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly."
906,"Yeah, can't help but.",How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? I wrapped those bad boys.
907,"All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.",I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married?
908,That commercial always makes me so sad.,"Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK."
909,,"Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got."
910,Rhythm?,"No, my first fan mail."
911,"This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.","Oh my god, I got my very own stalker."
912,,"Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?"
913,It's Erica.,"Ah, the stalker."
914,"Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.",Let's get out of here.
915,The one time they're not home.,"OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met."
916,That's how radio stars escape stalkers.,She's comin'.
917,It's me.,"Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?"
918,Hi.,Erica.
919,"Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?",Yeah it is. . . what?
920,"Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord.","Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites."
921,Who's they?,No one.
922,"Oh Drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. Oh these hands, these beautiful hands, oh I could just eat them. . . but I won't.","Good, otherwise my watch would fall off."
923,"No, seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life-giving hands. Oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?","Alright, just one. Wow, you're good at that."
924,"I don't understand, why didn't you help that man?","Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something."
925,"No, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. You don't have to explain yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore?",But that's what...
926,I should just be happy to be near you.,Hey I-
927,Hey what?,"That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! Hey. He-hey."
928,You're the only one who can save her Drake.,"Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God."
929,It's Erica.,"Oh my God, quick turn off the TV."
930,"No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens.","Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out."
931,"Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.","Hey Erica, c'mon in."
932,"How did you get here so fast, I just saw you in Salem?","Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up?"
933,"Ohh, and I see you're having a little party too. Is she here, huh, huh?",Who?
934,Sabrina. I know about you two. I saw you today kissing in the doctor's lounge.,"It's not what you think, that was..."
935,You told me I was the only one.,"Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor."
936,Oh my God. Do the people at the hospital know about this?,Somebody wanna help me out here?
937,"How, how can you be here and there.",'Cause it's a television show.
938,"Drake, what're you getting at?",I'm not Drake.
939,Is all this true?,"Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you."
940,Hans...Hans...Yo evil twin.,"Right. Goodbye Erica, good luck in Salem. Take care"
941,I'll never forget you Hans.,"OK, alright, the people who threw the water."
942,You're kidding.,This is amazing.
943,I know.,I finally get a part on TV and the monkey's makin' movies.
944,"Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...",Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey.
945,"Good morning. Hey pal, look who I brought. It's your old friend Harry Elefante.","Woah, dude, burn."

947,The one in the director's chair.,"Gotcha. Phoebs, walk with me."
948,"OK. Um, how come I'm walking with you?","Well, we're, we're just goin' over here so that we can get away from the horrible flesh eating virus, for the love of God woman, listen to me. Is he lookin', is he lookin'?"
949,And then Jean-Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore.,"Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around, huh."
950,"Hey Joey I have to cancel racketball for tonight, that was Marcel's trainer. He's gonna let me have him for a couple of hours.",You're blowin' me off for a monkey?

961,"No, no, this is the first time.","Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes."
962,"I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them.","Well, let me see."
963,"No. I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever.","Alright, alright. Woah, someone's flossing."
964,"Joey, some people don't like that.",Chandler's wearing panties.
965,"Alright, one of you give me your underpants.","Can't help you, I'm not wearing any."
966,How can you not be wearing any underwear?,"Oh, I'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong."
967,"I'm almost done with it, keep your panties on.","Hey, hey, and I'm in the movie."
968,What happened?,"One of the virus victims called in sick, so Cathy recommended me and boom, I'm dying on the gurney. Oh Ross, Marcel just finished his last scene if you want to go down there and say goodbye."

983,"Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?","Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?"
984,"OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . wrist.

1014,Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. You used my toothbrush?,"Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain."
1015,"Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.","Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?"
1016,Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.,"Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash."
1017,Hey.,Hey.
1018,"Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What's the occasion?","Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a brunch."
1019,"Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.","Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?"
1020,"Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?",So where you gettin' it?
1021,"Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.","Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?"
1022,,Can you believe this place?
1023,"I know, this is a great apartment.","Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes."
1024,Hey.,"Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man."
1025,Thanks. You want it?,Huh?
1026,"Yeah, I'm movin' to a bigger place. You should definitely take this one.","Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?"
1027,,Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.
1028,"Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.","Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love."
1029,Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.,"Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it."
1030,What?,"I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore."
1031,"Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.","What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie."
1032,"Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.",Well that's how I feel.
1033,Well then maybe you should take it.,Well then maybe I will.
1034,Fine with me.,"Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons."

1040,Lick away my man.,"These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones."
1041,What?,"Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment."
1042,"No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?",I'm movin' out like we talked about.
1043,Well I didn't think that was serious. Ya know I thought that was just a fight.,"Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever."
1044,"Well, there you go.","Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry."
1045,"Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.",Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?
1046,I did pay for half of it.,"Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half."
1047,"Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.","Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass."
1048,Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.,"Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister?"

1050,Stop talkin' to your men.,Yes! And the table is mine.
1051,,"Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?"
1052,"Yeah, who's gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and - is that my bra? What the hell you doin' with my bra?","Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street."
1053,"So, uhh, em, you want me to uh, give you a hand with the foosball table?","Naa, you keep it, you need the practice."
1054,Thanks.,"So, I guess this is it."
1055,"Yeah, right, yeah, I guess so.","Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again."
1056,"Well, I'm guessing uh, tonight at the coffee house.","Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care."

1058,"Wow Joey, this is, uhh...",Art.

1073,I still can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant.,"Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Blepe."
1074,"Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Blepe?","Hey, hey, they're runnin'"
1075,But I thought you wanted to live by yourself.,"I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think."
1076,"Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?","You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad."
1077,,Hey.
1078,"So uhh, how's the palace?",You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin'... what's with the boxes?
1079,Nice to meet ya.,"Likewise. Uh, I'll take that. It's what I came for. So, this is new. Where'd you two meet?"
1080,"At the uh, supermarket, in the uh, ethnic food section. I helped him pick out a chorizo.",Wow.

1084,"Hi Joey, what's goin' on man?",Eddie.
1085,Morning.,"Morning. I just uh, came by to pick up my mail. Where's the mail?"
1086,"Oh it's uh, over there on the table.",You don't keep it over here on this table any more?
1087,"Oh, ooh.",Huh.
1088,What?,"No I just uh, thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, a-la me."
1089,See ya.,So how you two gettin' along?
1090,"Oh, I couldn't be happier.","Great, well, I'm happy for ya. Alright that's it. He just comes in here, Mr. Jonny Neweggs, with his, his, his movin' the mail and his, his 'see ya pals'. And now there's no juice. There's no juice f or the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice."
1091,There's another carton right over there.,"Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man."
1092,"Alright, so what's it about?","Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?"
1093,Well I like both eggs equally.,Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.
1094,Joey.,It may not be a bed of roses.
1095,So what happens next?,"Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed."
1096,,"Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out."
1097,"Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests.","Page 42, page 42, page 42."
1098,"Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.' Ooh, cool picture.","Ooh, I look good."
1099,"Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?","Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'"
1100,"Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?","Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?"
1101,,"I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?"
1102,"Uhh, I don't know, I just bring the scripts.","They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son."
1103,Right. Could you sign this?,"No. No way, I'm not signing that."
1104,I don't think that's gonna affect the plot of the show.,How can they do this to me?
1105,Open up. We want to talk to you.,I don't feel like talkin.
1106,Sorry Joey,Hey.
1107,How could you not tell us?,"I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out."
1108,"Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back.","Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin."
1109,"But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera.","Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me."
1110,It's gonna be ok. You know that?,"No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life."
1111,"Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us.","No, that means nothin to me."
1112,,Hey.
1113,"Hey. Whe-ell, look at you, finally got that time machine workin' huh?","Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have?"
1114,A mirror?,"Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty."
1115,"Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.","Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache."
1116,Cache? Jaunty?,Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I'm gonna get some coffee.
1117,"Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip.",Anybody want a croan.
1118,Don't worry about it already. Things happen.,"So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?"
1119,"Joey, look at me, look at me. Do I have lipstick on my teeth?","No, can we get back to me?"
1120,"Look honey, people get fired left and right in this business. I already got you an audition for Another World.",Alright. Cab driver number two?
1121,You're welcome.,But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?
1122,"Things change, roll with em.","But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this."
1123,"Joey, I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told Al Minser and his pyramid of dogs. Take any job you can get and don't make on the floor.",I'm sorry. See ya.
1124,,What is it?
1125,"I, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it.","See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh."
1126,"What, what's that?",It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good.
1127,"Open it, open in.",Oh my God.
1128,Woah.,"Look at this, how did I spend so much money?"
1129,"Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due.",Ahh.
1130,"What, woah, woah, $3500 at porcelain safari?","My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do."
1131,Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on Another World.,What?
1132,That audition.,That's a two line part.
1133,"Joey, you owe $1100 at I Love Lucite.",So what.
1134,"So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money.","Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic."
1135,Toilet paper?,Yeah.
1136,"Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic.","Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend."
1137,I am your friend.,"Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'"
1138,But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.,"Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe."
1139,"Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another.","Look, I don't wanna hear this right now."
1140,"Huh, I'm just saying...",Well don't just say.
1141,"Ya know, maybe, maybe I should just go.",Ok.
1142,"Ok. I'll see ya later. Just think about it, ok.","I don't need to think about it. I was Dr. Drake Remoray. That was huge. Big things are gonna happen, you'll see. Ross, you still there?"
1143,,"Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go."
1144,Lemonade? You ok man?,"Ah, it's career stuff. I don't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show."
1145,"Oh, that's too bad. How'd they do it?",I fell down an elevator shaft.
1146,That sucks. I was buried in an avalanche.,What?
1147,,"All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gonna cost you about so bucks."
1148,"Excuse me, that's 50 bucks.",What?
1149,Five oh dollars.,"Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything."
1150,That's great.,"And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting."
1151,"Ok, listen, thanks for coming in.","No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. You were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. I'll have a good day."
1152,,"Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose."
1153,"Oh my God, what's goin' on?",They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.
1154,"No look I wasn''t right, that's what I came here to tell you. I was totally hung up on, on my own stuff. Listen, I'm someone who needs the whole security thing, ya know. To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you, you don't need that and that's amazing to me. I could never do what you do Joey.",Thanks Ross.
1155,Yeah. And you should hold out for something bigger. I can't tell you how much respect I have for you not going to that stupid cab driver audition.,I went.
1156,"Great, how did it go?",I didn't get it.
1157,Good for you.,What?
1158,You're livin' the dream.,Huh?
1159,All right then.,"Oh, not my parrot."
1160,What?,I can't watch this.
1161,Dollars? You spent $1200 dollars on a plastic bird?,"Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register."
1162,I'll take it. My gift to you man.,Thanks Ross. I really like that bird though...I'll take the dog though.
1163,"I, I'm sorry, I uh I already have a roommate.",Hello.
1164,"Well I, I think we'd remember something like that.",I know I would.
1165,"Well that's uh, that's a good point. Um ok, well, uh, I guess I got the wrong apartment then. I, I'm, look, I'm, ya know, I'm sorry, I'm terriably sorry.",Hey no problem.
1166,See ya. Goodbuy you fruit drying psychopath. So you want me to help you unpack your stuff?,"Na, na I'm ok. Oh and uh, just so you know, I'm not movin' back in 'cause I have to. Well, I mean, I do have to. It's just that that place wasn't really, I mean, this is..."
1167,Welcome home man.,A little foos?
1168,Absolutely.,What happened to the foosball?
1169,"Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?",He paid a lot of money for it.
1170,"I'm gonna hold him a different way. Look I don't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?","Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky."
1171,"Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.","Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over."
1172,"Well, how do you find clothes that fit?","Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question."
1173,"Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look.","No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket."
1174,"Ok. Hey, why don't you ask Richard?","Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?"
1175,"I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game? What?",I don't know.
1176,"So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag.",How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?
1177,"Ok, this could be tough.","Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar."
1178,Hey.,Hey.
1179,"Hey. Where is he, where's Richard? Did you ditch him?","Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie. What's the matter with you, he's parking the car."
1180,"Wow, he must like you the best.","Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats ."
1181,"You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car .",No problem. Hey Chandler
1182,I think they get it.,Ok.
1183,There's the man.,He-he-eyy.
1184,"Hey, you're gettin' better. I'm gonna keep this by the way.",Ok. He kept my dollar.
1185,"Look. Joey, do you know we can see you from here?",How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?
1186,"You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.","Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him."
1187,"So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?","Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks."
1188,You're meeting Richard?,"Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game."
1189,You hear that? We're the guys.,We're the guys.
1190,"But... he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and... BAM! Yes! Could that shot BE any prettier?",Man you are incredible.
1191,"Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time.","Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with."
1192,Well.,"No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this. He is so much cooler than our dads. I mean, you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just- ow, ow. What are you kickin me for? Huh? I'm tryin to talk here."
1193,"Uh, you guys see me as a dad?",Oh yeah.
1194,No.,Nooooo.
1195,You're not a dad. You're not a dad.,Not a dad.
1196,,"Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?"
1197,Wow.,Freaky.
1198,How can I not do it? I have $127 in the bank.,"Monica, relax, go get a beer."
1199,I don't want a beer.,Who said it was for you?
1200,Noo.,You're kiddin'.
1201,"Ohhh Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one.","Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back."
1202,"My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had invested my $127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have...a lot more than that today. Ya know what, I'm gonna do it.",Do what?
1203,,"See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea?"
1204,"We love you, we're here for you.","Yeah good luck, good luck."
1205,Thanks.,"Hey Rach, you uh, you want some sandwich?"
1206,"Ohh, what is in that?","Olive loaf and ham spread, no mayo."
1207,"No no no, doggie please. Oh, I do so wanna love all animals, please no.","Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone?"
1208,"Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of crap. Ok, alright, we have a problem.",Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline.
1209,"Ok, here, I know what we can do.","Hey, hey, hey no."
1210,"Ok, doggie get the- aahhh. Ok go get the sandwich, get the sandwich doggie. Good doggie get the sandwich, get the...ok, Joey, the dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich, what does that say?","Well if he's not gonna eat it, I will."
1211,Are you crazy?,"Phoebs, he's just a little dog. Ahhh."
1212,,"Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go."
1213,"Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand.","Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?"
1214,What was that?,"Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now."
1215,Time is money my friend?,"Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.'"
1216,"Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?","Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50."
1217,"Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.",How come those?
1218,"MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.",That is so not my motto.
1219,"Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, he said that the little fella's gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow.",Good.
1220,"I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone. What am I gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.'","Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it."
1221,She'll be a much better friend when the market closes.,It's a woman.
1222,So talk to her.,"Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye."
1223,Why the voice.,Hard to say.
1224,"Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.","Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there."
1225,"Alright, hang on a second there Custer.","Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?"
1226,"Yeah, sure.",By someone besides Monica?
1227,Hi Monica.,"He-he-he, how's it goin'?"
1228,"Guys guys, check this out.",Excellent.
1229,Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?,Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?
1230,"Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.","Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper."
1231,Why not her?,"Cause she uh, she steals stuff."
1232,Joey that is horriable.,"Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared."
1233,"I'm sorry, I didn't know.","I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok."
1234,"Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?","Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals."
1235,It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.,"Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo."
1236,"So, basically just a Chinese guy.","Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed."
1237,"Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?","Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, oh, ok we can come back out in the living room."
1238,Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.,Right this is staging.
1239,"Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.",This is clearly in the wrong apartment.
1240,"Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party.",Quick volleyball question.
1241,Volleyball.,"Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?"
1242,Ok.,"Ahh, you drive safe."
1243,"Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway.","Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. Well, ok, you take care."
1244,"Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.",Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.
1245,"Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.","Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?"
1246,Hiii.,"Oh no, what happened?"
1247,Well I've had it.,"Yeah, I've had it."
1248,"Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.",But don't you need experience for a job like that?
1249,No kidding.,"Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call."
1250,Where do you work?,"Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more."
1251,"Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. Ha-ha-ha...",Ha-ha. Are all you processors dorks?
1252,,Hey.
1253,"Hey, how's the first day goin'?",Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.
1254,Well there you go.,"Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie."
1255,"Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?","Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?"
1256,Weird world. Your kids?,I figure my character has kids.
1257,Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.,"Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does."
1258,"Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.","Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did."
1259,,"You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it."
1260,"Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gonna have to set that up. Oh, I better get back. Hope the baby feels better.","Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie."
1261,Bye bye Joey.,What a phony.
1262,"Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.",Sir.
1263,"I have a family, I'm gonna be here.","Yeah Bing, what's that about?"
1264,Rough numbers?,This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.
1265,"Uh, if you say so sir.","Joseph's good, isn't he?"
1266,"Well, I'm going to kill you.","Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers."
1267,Why?,"Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say."
1268,,Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
1269,Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?,'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
1270,"Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?","Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know."
1271,"Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.","What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph."
1272,"I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.","Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department."
1273,"Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.",Karen.
1274,"Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.",Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.
1275,"Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.",Really?
1276,"No freakshow, she's fictional.","Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else."
1277,Thank you.,"It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot."
1278,"Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?",Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.
1279,Who?,All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.
1280,Wow!,"Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy."
1281,'Cause he was just so darn cute.,"No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses."
1282,"Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. Or you just do it.","I did do it, I'm a professional."
1283,Then what's the problem?,"See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother."
1284,"Hey, what did your agent say?","Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me."
1285,"Yeah, right.","Come on, I need your help here."
1286,"All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.","You see this, this is a friend."
1287,"Uh-huh, let's go. Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend.",Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?
1288,"Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.","Yeah, that makes sense."
1289,,"Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much. Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone."
1290,"I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.","Aww, Rach, I think you look cute And you, uh, you, you I could eat with a spoon ."
1291,Richard buzzed. He's waiting downstairs.,"Oh, Richard's here. I should run down say bye to him"
1292,It could be like a big giant guy.,"Man, I got this close to him and Monica kneed me in the back. What's going on?"
1293,We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.,"Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men."
1294,I can't believe she's married.,"Aw, man I'm sorry . This must be very tough for ya, huh ."
1295,,"Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight. I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....Hello? Hello?"
1296,"All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes .","Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl."
1297,,I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.
1298,Morning.,"Morning, hey, you made pancakes?"
1299,"Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man to cheer up. Good morning Joey.",Good morning.
1300,"Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.",Kiss her! Kiss her!
1301,"I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey.",B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
1302,"Nope, not this time.","Come on, quite yankin' me."
1303,I'm not yanking you.,This is Janice.
1304,"Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.","Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking."
1305,What are you the memory woman?,Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything.
1306,"Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute.",Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
1307,"Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?",There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?
1308,"Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.","Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?"
1309,Hey!,Wheel!
1310,Of!,Fortune! This guy is so stupid. It's Count Rushmore!!
1311,"You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?","I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?"
1312,"No, Janice.","Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers."
1313,"You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?","No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. . Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?"
1314,"Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!","Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know."
1315,"Well, there you go.","Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?"
1316,"Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! Don't worry, those are the right letters.","Look, what do you want me to say?"
1317,I want you to say that you like her!,"I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her."
1318,"Thanks for trying. Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!","Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?"
1319,"So, I hear, you hate me!","I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that."
1320,A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.,And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
1321,"All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, We've got to do something about our little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea you and me spending some quality time together.",But what does that gonna do...
1322,For Chandler!,Okay. I'm in.
1323,Okay. All right. This is what we're gonna call it 'Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!',Does it have to be a whole day?
1324,"Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me.","Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room."
1325,We're baack!,Hey!
1326,Really.,"Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. You have got competition buddy."
1327,You still can't stand her can you?,"I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did."
1328,"Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.","But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium."
1329,"Well, I guess that's something.","No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway."
1330,Okay.,"Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross."
1331,Oh God!,"Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too."
1332,Really?,"Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex."
1333,,"All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider."
1334,Taste it.,"Yep, it's fat. I drank fat!"
1335,Why aren't you guys dressed?,We have a half hour.
1336,"No, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door at twenty to eight.","Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed."
1337,"'Cause, I'm a stupid, stupid man.","Hey, Ross, want some cider?"
1338,"Yeah! Once, I figure out what I'm wearing.",Glass of fat?
1339,,What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech?
1340,No! Do you wanna hear it?,Am I in it?
1341,Hey!,Whoa!
1342,"All right, I took the quiz, and it turns out, I do put career before men. Get up.",What?
1343,You're in my seat.,How is this your seat?
1344,'Cause I was sitting there.,But then you left.
1345,"Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back.","What's the big deal, sit somewhere else."
1346,"The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.","Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo..."
1347,"Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called Get Up.",All right! You can have the chair.
1348,Really!,"Oh my, would you look at that!"
1349,Sorry Phoebe.,I'm so sorry.
1350,"All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. I'm soooo, comfortable.","Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable."
1351,"Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough.","Monica, how are you gonna do that?"
1352,"""""""You have two new messages.""""""","Wow, what a cool job. 'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.'"
1353,"""""""Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy.""""""","Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy."
1354,"Hola, it's me, yesterday was really fun. Call me about this weekend, okay.",Now she sounded breezy.
1355,"""All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, """"Get out of my chair, dillhole!""""""",Okay.
1356,What are you doing?,"You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions."
1357,The cushions are the essence of the chair!,That's right! I'm taking the essence.
1358,"Hey, what you do on your own time...",Where's my underwear?!
1359,"Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?","Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now."
1360,"Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?",It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
1361,"Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.","Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you."
1362,"What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?","Hey, opposite, is opposite!"
1363,,"Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own."
1364,Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!,Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
1365,Oooo-ooh!,"Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges."
1366,"Jeez, what a baby.","Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed."
1367,"You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.",You could drink the fat.
1368,I think you should drink the fat.,Yaaaay!
1369,You were gonna drink the fat.,Let's see what else he'll do!
1370,,WHOAA!!
1371,,Hey.
1372,"Aww, is it broken?","No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks."
1373,Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?,Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
1374,"Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.",What is this? Fruit?
1375,Monica's making jam.,"Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?"
1376,"I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot.",This will just be my batch.
1377,,Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?
1378,"Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.",You talked to him. Are you crazy?
1379,"No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.","Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean"
1380,"Joey, this is for you. It's blackberry curin.",Aww. Ohh!
1381,"Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked , or, or a big tub of jam.",Put your hands together.
1382,"Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.",No more jam?!
1383,"Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?",Check it out!! Jam crackers!
1384,"Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. Oh my God, under personal comments 'New York Knicks, rule!'","Yeah, the Knicks rule!"
1385,"Joey, this is you!","Let me see. Oh, right."
1386,When did you go to a sperm bank?,"Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?"
1387,And that's how you bought it?,"Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left."
1388,"Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.","Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little."
1389,"Thank you, Monica.","Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes."
1390,,Hey.
1391,Hey.,Where you going?
1392,To the bank.,Sperm or regular?
1393,Sperm.,"So you're really doing this, huh?"
1394,"Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135.",Sounds nice.
1395,"'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...","No kiddin', hmm."
1396,What?,"No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy."
1397,Really? Why?,"I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt."
1398,Hoyt?,"It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool."
1399,"Really, is he a swimmer?",He's got the body for it.
1400,I like that. What?,"You guys have one of those signs that says 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know."
1401,We do not have one of those signs.,"Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids."
1402,Two girls and a boy?,Yeah!
1403,"And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.","Sure! But hey, you know this way sounds good too."
1404,Yeah.,"Oh Monica. Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, for like a day. ."
1405,,"I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it Maybe if they met me in person."
1406,"Honey, you got a little thing on your...",Did I get it?
1407,"Oh, oh! It's on again!","You guys, can we please not watch this all right."
1408,"Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk, and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.","Oh, you said it Mike. Aw! There's got to be a better way!"
1409,And there is Kevin.,Can we please turn this off?
1410,"Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do. Go ahead. This works with any milk carton.","Wow, it is easy. Now, I can have milk everyday."
1411,"Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this, so that you can bunny bump against my back.",Hey!
1412,"Hey, man. What's up?",Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!
1413,"Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh! Okay, it was me!",How is it you?
1414,"Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it.","Yep, that's my audition."
1415,What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment.,"Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance."
1416,That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.,"Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents."
1417,"What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh .","What, what are you doing? What are you doing?"
1418,"No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh. 'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'","Hang up, hang up."
1419,I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?,I love that movie.
1420,"There it is. Joey, what are you doing?","I'm sorry, it just felt nice."
1421,Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.,"Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater."
1422,"Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.","Hey, you know about that?!"
1423,Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?,"Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was."
1424,You think?,"Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!"
1425,"Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents.","Come on baby, come on!"
1426,Unbelievable.,Thank you so much.
1427,"It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.","You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in."
1428,"Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.","Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two."
1429,Two?,"Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you."
1430,"Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right","Nooo, four."
1431,G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?,G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?
1432,"Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!",Go Joe!!!
1433,Helloo! Oh!,Pheebs! There you are!
1434,"No it's not, sorry.","But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe!"
1435,"Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in those....pants.","Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it."
1436,"Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.","It's okay, these things happen."
1437,"But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.","I'm, I'm okay. See."
1438,"Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.","No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally."
1439,"Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.",They actually said that?
1440,"Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I...","No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this. I canna work on a new accent."
1441,"Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.","Okay, shoot."
1442,"Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.",I didn't get it?
1443,"No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that.","Okay, what else?"
1444,"Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'",Oh.
1445,"Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'","Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle."
1446,Oh.,"Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out."
1447,"Yeah, no, I understand.","You do, thanks."
1448,Yeah. Sorry.,Wait a minute.
1449,What?,"Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent."
1450,"Oh, you caught me. I am so busted.",That's-ah what I suspected-ah.
1451,Hey!,Hey!
1452,Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?,No. Y'know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail.
1453,Yeah!,"Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step."
1454,You're building a post office?,"No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It's a one day job, max."
1455,Okay. My word! Those are snug.,"Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente's."
1456,,Power saw kinda got away from me there.
1457,"All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.",Her what?
1458,"I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.","Hey, Monica, who would yours be?"
1459,"First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.","It's just a game Mon. Rach, how about you?"
1460,Joey.,Hey-hey!
1461,"You know, we don't really take advantage of living in the city.",I know.
1462,,"Oh, I'm sorry. Did I get 'ya?"
1463,"No, you didn't get me!! It's an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!","Calm down, do you want this unit or not?"
1464,I do NOT want this unit!!,"Well, you should've told me that before, I'm not a mind reader. Hey, we're out of beer. I'm going to Monica's."
1465,Hey! Where 'ya headin' in those pants? 1982?,"Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor."
1466,"Why, what's wrong with my bathroom floor?","Nothing. It's just old and dingy, that's all."
1467,I highly doubt that.,"Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be. Yeah."
1468,I can't live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?,Relax. Here hold this . This old stuff just comes right off.
1469,That's a little more than I wanted to see.,"Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. It'd take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it."
1470,,Eh! There you go.
1471,"Oh, just this! Y'know what it's my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish.","Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles."
1472,"Well, it's about time.","Ooh, very official."
1473,"Okay, on three. One....Two....",Why don't we just go on two.
1474,Why two?,Because it's faster.
1475,Oh!,"All right, but in the future..."
1476,"Okay, one...two...",So we are going on two?
1477,"Oh, good job Joe.","Wow, it's big!"
1478,"Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!","Maybe, my ruler's wrong."
1479,Maybe all the rulers are wrong.,"Look it's not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door."
1480,"Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how 'bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours?","Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet."
1481,,Y'know what?
1482,Umm?,I bet 'ya ya I could fit in there.
1483,I've got five bucks says you can't.,"Get out your checkbook, mister."
1484,,You are dogged man! I totally fit!
1485,"Yeah, you got me. I'm out five big ones! Here you go.","Thank you. Cha-ching! Oh, well hello Mr. Lincoln. Better luck next time buddy. And the drinks are on me!"
1486,"Come on over the years none of you ever y'know, got drunk and stupid.","Well, that's really a different question."
1487,I'm sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.,"Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together."
1488,"Excuse me, there was no time!","Okay, but let's say there was. How might that go?"
1489,"Yeah, I'll take some.","Hey, there's a dog out there!"
1490,"Bedroom. Bathroom. Living room. This right here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by, Bye-bye.","Don't you ah, don't you wanna ask me any questions?"
1491,Sure. Ummm. What's up?,"Well, ah, I'm an actor. I'm fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and don't worry I'm totally okay with the gay thing."
1492,What gay thing?,"Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I'm totally cool with that."
1493,Hi.,Hey!
1494,"Hi, again.",Hey!
1495,You want some help with that?,"Oh, no thanks, I got it. No I don't!"
1496,Whoa! Are you okay?,"Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush."
1497,It's the heat. And-and the humidity.,"That's a uh, that's a tough combination."
1498,Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?,Like you wouldn't believe. Wow! This is a great place.
1499,Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.,Gotcha.
1500,"This place is really my Grandmother's. I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I'm 87 year old woman, who's afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?","Oh, you bet I am!"
1501,Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!,"You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?"
1502,So?!,"Whoa, ah!! We're you just gonna give me some lemonade?"
1503,Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!,"Oh right, right."
1504,"I don't believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?","Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I'm such a jerk."
1505,"So ah, whatcha watching?",Baywatch.
1506,What's it about?,Lifeguards.
1507,"Well, it sounds kinda stupid... Who's she?",Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.
1508,Wow! Look at them run.,"They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?"
1509,"Yeah, I'll go get one.","No, no, no, don't get up, I got a cooler right here."
1510,My wife's a lesbian.,Cool!!
1511,I was always Joanne.,"Question. Was ah, 'Egg the Gellers!' the war cry of your neighbourhood?"
1512,Ewww! Oh! It's the Mattress King!,Booo!!
1513,"Yeah, we'll see!","Hey, you guys!"
1514,Hey!,Guess what?
1515,What?,I got a gig!
1516,What's the part?,"Well, it's not a part, no. I'm teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension."
1517,Wow!,"Yeah, yeah. It's like my chance to give something back to the acting community."
1518,Y'know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.,I know!
1519,,"Good evening. I'm Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for soap operas. Now um, on my first day as Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives, I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don't have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like this. Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along."
1520,,Hi!
1521,Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?,"Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, 'Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you, I dismiss you.'"
1522,"Ooooh, nice.","Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children."
1523,"Oh, yay!","Yeah, it's this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I'm so, so right for it, y'know, he's just like me. Except he's a boxer, and has an evil twin."
1524,"Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It's that bedroom there.","Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?"
1525,"Yeah, so please, please, please, don't say anything to Chandler.",You want me to lie to Chandler?
1526,Is that a problem?,No.
1527,"Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let's see what you got. All right ya, put 'em up. Come on.","Hey, you're ah, pretty good at this."
1528,"Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young men weren't acting Christian enough.",Ahh!
1529,,Hey now!
1530,,Hey!!! Oww!! And I'm bleeding.
1531,Oh! Oh! Oh!,"Okay, great."
1532,"Wow! And I'm a vegetarian! All right, all right, well I'm sorry, we'll put some ice on it.",Okay.
1533,"'Kay, put your head back.",All right. I can't see.
1534,,"Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. And that's how it's done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed."
1535,"Hey, Mr. Trib.",Hey-hey.
1536,"Guess what, I got an audition!","Awww, one of my students got an audition. I'm so proud."
1537,I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?,You bet! What's the part?
1538,"Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that's not gonna be me, not me.",Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?
1539,No.,Whoa. That was really good.
1540,You told him to play the boxer gay!!,"Well, I-I might've said supergay."
1541,"Joey, you're this guy's teacher. I mean how could you do this?","Because, Monica, the guy's so good, and I really, really want this part."
1542,,"There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he's got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you."
1543,"Look, it's like I told you, there's nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller.","All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king."
1544,Nobody sees the king!,"Oh-ho-kay, I'm talking to the king."
1545,"Although, don't feel like you can't visit.","Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?"
1546,"What? So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?","Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not."
1547,"Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.","It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him."
1548,,Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock. It's like a Play-Doo Fat Factory.
1549,"Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.",What did they do?
1550,"You? You! Want to watch Ben? Yes! That'd be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is.","Hey-hey, Ross?"
1551,Yeah.,I've got a science question.
1552,Hmm?,"If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact 'Homo-sapien', is that why there extinct?"
1553,"Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.","Hey-hey, I'm not judging."
1554,"Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?",I'd really prefer a mountain bike.
1555,"Janice's birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.","Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum."
1556,"That's a good idea, 'Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday'. I would like to get her something serious.","Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious."
1557,"All right. Look, I'm gonna go in here, and you don't buy me anything ever.","No, no, you can't, you can't, okay, you can't, you can't buy her pearls, you just can't, you can't, you can't."
1558,Why not?!,"Oh God. Uh, okay, here's the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is..."
1559,What is the thing?,"Okay. I went down to the 'Mattress King' showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband."
1560,What?,They were in his office.
1561,"Well she, she wouldn't do that, she's with, she's with me.","I'm telling you man, I saw it."
1562,"Yeah, well, you're wrong! Okay, you're wrong.","I'm not wrong! I wish I was. I'm sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn't sound so bad now, huh?"
1563,"Monica, number one, I don't think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I... What?!",You said number two.
1564,I also said number one.,I know.
1565,"Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive.",Uh.
1566,What?,Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still.
1567,Well maybe he's just taking a nap.,"I'm tellin' ya, he hasn't moved since this morning."
1568,How are we gonna do that? There's no way.,"Well, there is one way. His window's open, I say, we poke him."
1569,,"Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?"
1570,Yeah.,"Well, now we got a reason."
1571,What?,"Well, we're fashioning a very long poking device."
1572,All right.,"Hey uh, what's a matter?"
1573,I talked to Janice.,"Oh my God, is she going back to him?"
1574,"She doesn't know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the reciept!","What are you ah, what are you gonna do?"
1575,"I don't know, y'know. What, what, would you do?","Well, it doesn't matter what I would do."
1576,"Come on, tell me.","All right, you're probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me, I would ah, I would bow out."
1577,"What? What are you, what are you talking about?","They have a kid together, y'know. They're like, they're like a family, and if, I don't know, there's chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?"
1578,,"All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area."
1579,I'm telling you he's dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.,"All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's poke. Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle. Okay, okay, we're approaching the window Thread the needle. Thread the needle."
1580,"And yet, we're still poking him.","Okay, retract the device, retract the device."
1581,"Hey-hey, now he's showing us his poking device.","Hey, that's never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!"
1582,Halftime.,"Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?"
1583,"Oh, can I play too? I've never played football, like ever.","Great, you can cover Chandler."
1584,"No, no, no, I don't, I don't really wanna play.",Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
1585,That's not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don't say that I don't have goals!,"Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice, and if you don't play, everyone will be mad at you 'cause the teams won't be even. Come on."
1586,"Um, Monica and I aren't supposed to play football.",Says who? Your mom?
1587,That almost hit me in the face.,"All right, we have to pick captains."
1588,"Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.",Thank you.
1589,Huddle up.,"All right, huddle up, right over here."

1592,,Set....hike!
1593,,"Haaaaa! Hey-hey, thanks for stopping our ball."
1594,You are playing American football?,"Yeah! Wow, your like from a whole other country."
1595,I'm Dutch.,"Hi-hi, I'm Joey."
1596,I'm Margha.,"I'm sorry Dutch, I didn't get that last little bit."
1597,"Hello, Chandler.","Her name is Dutch, and also Marklan."
1598,Margha.,Mar-klan.
1599,"Well, that went well.",I think so.
1600,"Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.","Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know."
1601,"Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.","Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I'll let you have her."
1602,"Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn't I wouldn't have a shot?","Well I don't like to say it out loud, but, yeah! Don't feel bad man, we all have our strengths. You're better with numbers and stuff."
1603,,Fumble!
1604,,What the hell's the matter with you?! This is my favourite jersey.
1605,"Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math.","All right, that's it. Y'know I was still gonna let you have her. But now, forget about it. Prepare to feel very bad about yourself."
1606,Oh I got it!! Oh! Ew! Broken boob! Ow!,"Pheebs, run!"
1607,Before the snap!,After!!
1608,"Come on Phoebe, let's go! Come on, it's time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.","It's hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl."
1609,"All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?",What are you gonna do?
1610,"All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I'll take care of the rest.",Okay.
1611,Break!,Here you go!
1612,"No-no-no-no, the game's not over, we're just switching teams.","Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it's better if we're on the same team."
1613,"No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?","Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania."
1614,"And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?",Nice try. See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.
1615,"Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let's play some ball, guys.","Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-I'm not playing with this guy, now."
1616,Yes!!,Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn't understand the question.
1617,"I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye.",Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
1618,Hey! It's 42-21!,"This sucks, I was just up by that much!"
1619,"I'm sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn't know what to do.",Thirty seconds left on the timer!
1620,"Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?","When they're hungry enough, they'll come in."
1621,"Look out kids, he's coming!",And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.
1622,"Have fun. Oh wait, no, don't! I forgot I am totally against that now.",What? Me having a job?
1623,"No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. Hey, how do you sleep at night?","Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy."
1624,Hey.,"Hey. What, what are you doing here?"
1625,"Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, oh, but oh...","Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas...."
1626,Destiny.,Sure.
1627,Yes.,All right.
1628,Okay. Yikes! That one doesn't look very fulfilled.,"Oh, that's, that's ah, one of the old ones, he's just taking it to the back."
1629,"You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.",Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
1630,"So, what happens to the old guys?","Well, they go into the chipper."
1631,"Why, do I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds? No! Nooooo!!!",Hey! Hey!!
1632,"...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.","All right, I'll take a box of the cream filled Jesus's."
1633,"I'm training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.","Look Rach, wasn't this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?"
1634,"Well, I'm also sending out.... good thoughts.","If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you've got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear."
1635,You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear....,Hey! I got great news!
1636,"Run, Joey! Run for your life!","What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?"
1637,No.,"Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?"
1638,"Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey.",Not a problem.
1639,Thanks.,And now for the great news.
1640,"What, that wasn't the great news?","Only if you think it's better than this... snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind of Christmas lookie."
1641,,"Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it's a little more money, but you get a nicer smell."
1642,"Okay but that's why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it's Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey","Yeah, the ah, trees that don't fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper."

1647,Um-mm.,"All right, give it back to me. 5 of hearts."
1648,"Wow. Joey, how do you do it?","I can't tell you that, no."
1649,,"All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I'll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. I just did it. I just did it, again. Here, I'll slow it down so that you guys can see it."
1650,"Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.","Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me."
1651,"Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.","Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know...."
1652,"Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?","I don't know, Chandler is supposed to be passin' 'em around..."
1653,,Chandler!
1654,Oh my!!,Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.
1655,"Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?","No, only for sex."
1656,Joey!!! Happy Birthday!!,Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!
1657,That's okay.,Can I talk to you for a second?!
1658,Hey.,Come on!!
1659,"Why can't we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.",I just got off the phone with my sister.
1660,"Ah, which, which one?",Mary-Angela.
1661,Mary-Angela.,Yeah.
1662,Y'know which one was she again?,"Why don't you ask Chandler, 'cause he's the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin' over Janice by groping my sister."
1663,It's gotta be the first one.,"Really? That's great! You and my sister, sittin' in a tree."
1664,"Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?",Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
1665,I'm here to see Mary-Angela.,"You are so the man! Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, 'cause my Grandma doesn't know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah."
1666,Where's Mary-Angela?,She's right in there.
1667,No Joey! No Joey! Don't Joey! Joey!,What's goin' on?
1668,It's no big deal. Chandler was just kissin' me because he thought I was Mary-Angela.,"What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?"
1669,"Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother's not going to punch me. Are ya?","Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!"
1670,Yeah! Punch him! Punch him!,"No! No! No! No, I'm not going to punch Chandler."
1671,I'll do it.,"No you won't. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he's sorry. But, you've got one more apology to make, all right, you've got to apologize to Mary-Angela."
1672,"Okay, absolutely!",All right.
1673,You've got it.,"Cookie, now you can punch him!"
1674,Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?,"All right, that's it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! But, is he a big guy?"
1675,Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! Don't cry outloud.,Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?
1676,"I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.","It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco."
1677,"Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities.",What?
1678,Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em.,Who?
1679,I'll get you the Cliff Notes.,The what?
1680,The abridgment.,"Oh, okay. The what?"
1681,,"You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, you've got to pick a pocket or two.........."
1682,"Lovely, just lovely.",Really? Thanks.
1683,"Listen Joey, we definitely want to see you for the callback on Saturday.","Excellent, I'll be there."
1684,"Okay, and listen don't forget to bring your jazz shoes for the dance audition.","Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part."
1685,....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!,"Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids either."
1686,"Well, can you dance at all?","Yeah, I can dance, y'know."
1687,"What, what is that?","Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing."
1688,"It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to write a poem.",Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.
1689,"Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.","Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?"
1690,"Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out.",The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty...
1691,"Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work.","Whoa, I'm not done."
1692,"Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.",Done.
1693,,Mark's a genius!
1694,"All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'","And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'"
1695,"Ah Joey. Joey Tribbiani. Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.","So, does that mean the audition is off?"
1696,"Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.",What?!
1697,"Aw come on Joey, it's easy. Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head, up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!","It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands."
1698,Have fun.,Bye.
1699,"No, no, no. What was that?","I know, it was the best I could get out of them."
1700,"Well, people!","People, people, people."
1701,Hey.,Look at you. Since when do you roller blade?
1702,Okay.,Cool.
1703,"It's not a date, okay. I'm just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.","Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you'll probably be hungry after the sex."
1704,Hey.,Hey.
1705,Do you have any ice?,"Check the freezer. If there's none in there, then we're probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It's late."
1706,"Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?",I discovered I'm able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
1707,"Hmm. Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?","Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so."
1708,"But ah, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer?","Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we've got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know."
1709,How often do you read it?,Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?
1710,"Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that's a classic, what's so great about The Shining?","The question should be Rach, what is not so great about the shining. Okay? And the answer would be nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it's way better than that classic of yours."
1711,"Okay. Ah, well we'll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining, and you will read Little Women.","All right, you got it."
1712,All right.,Okay.
1713,Okay.,"Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women."
1714,Yeah.,"How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?"
1715,,These little women. Wow!
1716,"Your liking it, huh?",Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo's manuscript. I don't see how he could ever forgive her.
1717,"Umm, Jo's a girl, it's short for Josephine.",But Jo's got a crush on Laurie. Oh. You mean it's like a girl-girl thing? 'Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.
1718,"No, actually Laurie's a boy.",No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.
1719,,"What are you doing? Get back over on your side of the... Hello!! Hi, I'm Joey, we haven't met."
1720,Hey.,"Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?"
1721,Hey!,Hey! How's it going?
1722,Good.,"Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?"
1723,"Oh, Danny just went into room 217.","Oooh, the next part's the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub..."
1724,"Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you're gonna ruin it!",All right I'll talk in code. Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
1725,"Hmmm, that's very cool.","Oh, all blank, and no blank, make's blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww!"
1726,"All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she's still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy.","Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad."
1727,,"Beth, Beth dies?"
1728,Um-hmm.,Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
1729,No. She doesn't die.,Then why would you say that?!
1730,What?,"Beth is really, really sick."
1731,Awwww.,"Jo's there, but I don't think there's anything she could do."
1732,Joey?,Yeah.
1733,Do you want to put the book in the freezer?,Okay.
1734,"'Cause every time I see your face, I can't help but fall from grace. I know.....",Wow! This girl is good.
1735,"All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I'd like know whether that's several big fish or just one big fish.","So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles."
1736,Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.,"Ah, anything we might of heard of?"
1737,"Ah, yeah, umm. Home is never far away..",Home is Home Star stew.
1738,"Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs.","Wow, that was kinda brutal."
1739,Where's Chandler?,"Ah, he can't make it, he said he had to his... Whoa-oh!"
1740,,"Phew, close one."
1741,You never run on a barge!,Hey.
1742,Hey.,"Is ah, is Chandler around?"
1743,"No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house.",Oooh.
1744,"Yeah, Ginger something.","Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?"
1745,"No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said, 'the movie star.'","Aww, man. That's the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he's my roommate, she's gonna tell him what I did."
1746,"Well, what did you do?","What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can't, I can't tell you that, it's like the most awful, horrible thing I've ever done my whole life."
1747,"Y'know what, don't tell us. We'll just wait until Chandler gets home, because it'll be more fun that way.","All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad's cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner...."
1748,You gave her food poisoning!?,"I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log."
1749,Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!,"I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should've told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg."
1750,"Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?",I ran!!
1751,"Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn't have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don't want to stop seeing her, but every so often it's like 'Hey, y'know what, where's your leg?' I mean I'm the smallest person in the world aren't I? I'm the smallest person in the world.",Morning.
1752,Actually he's the smallest person in the world.,Heard about the leg burnin' huh?
1753,It came up.,"Listen, I ah, I know it's a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?"
1754,"Sorry, Pheebs.",Yeah. You okay?
1755,"Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life's gonna had you all kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a new song?",Yeah.
1756,Well hello!,Where have you been?
1757,,"Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives?"
1758,"I won't give you anything, but you'll owe me 2.95.",Done.
1759,Hold on.,So Pheebs what's this guy like?
1760,"Well, if you don't have anything to copy, why are you going down there?","Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?"
1761,Yeah! You wanna come?,Yeah!
1762,Uh-oh.,"Uh, y'know what, we're having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we'll need a little more time to think about it."
1763,"Hey, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?",Both of us?
1764,Relax. It's just Issac's D.J.-ing at the Philly. You should come.,We'll be there.
1765,"Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?","Uh, 10:30."
1766,What time is it now?,4:30.
1767,"Yeah all right, so we'll hang out.","Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?"
1768,Yes. Vividly.,She was kidding about that right?
1769,"Yeah, I-I-I think so. Yeah, I-I think so...","God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?"
1770,"Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?","Dude, I don't know."
1771,She was kidding.,Yeah.
1772,"She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.","Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing."
1773,"Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there....","Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... y'know each would, y'know be?"
1774,"Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.","Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails?"
1775,,So what are you gonna do?
1776,Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.,"Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny."
1777,Why? What happened to him?,"Nothing, he's just really believes in that."
1778,Oh my God! Oh my God!,"Yeah. We figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?"
1779,"What?! Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?","Look, Ross look, I'm on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble."
1780,"He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her.","Yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild."
1781,"Yeah, okay.","All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way. Did you think about the trail?"
1782,What trail?,The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! You always have to think about the trail!
1783,"Yeah, well I don't think you can make that statement, unless you've been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.","Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that's all. I mean, come on, it's just a little wax."
1784,"Oh, that's mature.","Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?"
1785,,Don't answer that.
1786,,Awful! Horrible!
1787,She was not good. Not good.,She was nothing compared to you.
1788,,Ewwwww!
1789,,"Y'know what, I don't think we should listen to this anymore."
1790,"What, what are you doing? You can't go out there.",Why not?! I'm hungry.
1791,"Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.","Yeah, we'll be fine."
1792,,"Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. Put olives on the pizza."
1793,,You think I need a new walk?
1794,What?,"Well y'know, I've been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a 'take notice' walk."
1795,,"Whoa-ho-ho! Yeah, okay."
1796,They've been quiet for a long time.,Maybe she killed him?
1797,Is that your new walk?,"No, I really have to pee."
1798,,Can I see the comics?
1799,This is the New York Times.,"Okay, may I see the comics?"
1800,"Oh come on, they can be in the same room.","Yeah, you shoulda been there last night."
1801,Why? What happened now?,"Well Ross was hangin' out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler...."
1802,"Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.",Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
1803,Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He's the one who slept with someone else.,"Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now."
1804,"Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....",I had the same dream!
1805,"Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.","Oh, I had the opposite dream."
1806,"Y'know what maybe it's gonna be okay, I mean it's been a week.","Yeah, I mean it's never taken me a week to get over a relationship."
1807,"Oh, it's okay.","Rach, it's, it's ah, it's not that we don't want to, really. Are we talking models in their underwear?"
1808,And heels.,"Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside."
1809,"Ohhh boy, do I feel bad.",Oh yeah.
1810,Oh my God!,You're smoking again?!
1811,,"Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can cut glass over here!"
1812,"Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? Two days of darts, it'll be great!",It'll be great for next weekend.
1813,"No, no, no, this weekend guys!","It'll be great for next weekend. I mean, it'll be grrreat."
1814,"Y'know what, I can stay, I'm gonna stay. 'Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around.","Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother's cab, but y'know what, I'll stay."
1815,,"Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?"
1816,Well he's probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.,What? Mine aren't tinted.
1817,"Oh, come on, there's a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo.","Oh, now I have to go!!"
1818,"Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!",What's going on?
1819,Damn! The tailpipe's not hot enough to light this!,"Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?"
1820,"So, if you're parents hadn't got divorced, you'd be able to answer a question like a normal person?","Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!"
1821,What?!,Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?
1822,Please!!,"Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire."
1823,"No, not getting my bra!","If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call."
1824,"Okay, there.","Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous."
1825,"Okay, now let's decide who has the nicest ass.",And there you go!
1826,So the going for help went well?,"Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed."
1827,,"Okay, done."
1828,What's 'pleh'?,That's 'help' spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!
1829,,Arrrghh!!
1830,"Oh, this is horrible, it's just horrible.","Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?"
1831,Here we go again.,"I-I can't handle this, you guys."
1832,Really Joey?,What?
1833,,What?
1834,"Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! Look what you're doing to Chandler!! Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay? You don't, all right you don't have to love each other, okay? You don't, you don't even have to like each other much right now. But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other.","Yeah, and not put us in the middle."
1835,"Okay. Good, all right, let's get back in the car, 'cause it's freezing, and my chest is unsupported.","Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who's going with who?"
1836,"Look, you guys, you guys should go. No, I'm, you, you planned this all out, and I don't want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.","Come on man, you drove all the way up here."
1837,What's so funny?,"Oh, nothing, no. It's an acting exercise, I'm practising my fake laugh."
1838,Oh.,What-what's so funny?
1839,"Exactly, it'll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.","Yeah, or-or to get a hooker."
1840,"No-no, oh, I'm fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it's tongue down my little brother's throat!","Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it."
1841,"But, I mean, do you think he's gonna enjoy it when he's up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank, and it-it's not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it's not good home economics.","Well, have-have you told him how you feel?"
1842,"Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he's gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can't. But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it.",No-no-no-no-no.
1843,"Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!",No.
1844,"Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank.","""So, we're walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, """"Hey, let's go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes,"""" remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, """"Nah, let's just hang out at your place."""" Well, that was a nice move dumb ass."""
1845,All we're saying is don't rush into anything.,"Yeah, come on, think about it. You're 18, okay, she's 44, when you're 36, she's gonna be 88."
1846,"What, you don't think I know that?","Look, the point is, there's a lot of women out there you haven't even had sex with yet!"
1847,"Okay, but isn't sex better when it's with one person that you really, really care about.","Yeah, in a poem maybe."
1848,"Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I've got with Alice.","Now, wh-what, what is that like?"
1849,"Yeah, yeah.",Why can't I find that?
1850,"Don't ask me, I had it and I blew it!","Well, I want it!"
1851,You can have it!,"I don't know, maybe I can't. I mean, maybe there's something wrong with me."
1852,It's out there man! I've seen it! I got it!!,Then you hold on to it!!
1853,"All right, man!!","All right, congratulations you lucky bastard!"
1854,You're Frank's best man?!,"I couldn't help it, there love is so pure."
1855,Hi!!,Hey!
1856,,"Hey, how much cash do you got in your pocket right now?"
1857,,Every night!!
1858,"Cigarette's don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.",Joey's your best friEnd. You want to make him a cheese sandwich everyday. And you also want to buy him hundreds of dollars worth of pants.
1859,Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?,"Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie!"
1860,Joe. How's it going?,Good. Hey.
1861,Hi.,"Oh, so you're playing Adrienne, huh?"
1862,Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins?,"Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I'm Joey Tribianni."
1863,,"So the ah, play's pretty great, huh?"
1864,"Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murray's work. She's so brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle class.","Oh, forget about it. She rocks!"
1865,Where do I know you from?,Dr. Drake Remoray. Days of Our Lives. Voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat.
1866,"No, that's not it. So, you're a soap actor? Well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?","Hey, I've done plays before. I'm a serious actor."
1867,That info-mercial! For the milk carton spout thing! You're-you're-you're the guy that doesn't know how to pour milk!!,"See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I couldn't. Now, see, that's acting."
1868,"Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie.","Yeah, that was real."
1869,,"I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can't do it, they're all like-like laughing at me."
1870,So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.,"Wow, what-what do you think she wants?"
1871,"Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.","Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago."
1872,That's not a state Joe.,"Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?"
1873,Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?,"Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and nothin'. You look at me, and it's nothin'. Nothing."
1874,"Peel the onion. First of all, he's good looking.",Yeah.
1875,I think my character's gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.,"Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it's says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I don't know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you're a bitch."
1876,It doesn't say that in the script.,It does in mine!
1877,"I wasn't doing anything. Uh-oh, what did she do now?","Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she's like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!"
1878,"Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.","God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, 'Oh, I'm so talented.' and 'Oh, I'm so pretty,' and 'Ooh, I smell so good.'"
1879,I think somebody has a crush on somebody.,"Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?"
1880,"I'm talking about you. You big, big freak.","Oh. Ohh. Ohh, you're out of your mind."
1881,"Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you'd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!","Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!"
1882,Happy?! Is that what I'm supposed to be Vic? Happy?,"Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you and it's nothin'. You look at me, and nothin'. Nothing."
1883,"Well, that was ah...",Better?
1884,"Yeah! Yeah, it was definitely an improvement. G'night.","Ah, Kate?"
1885,Yeah?,"You ah, you forgot your shoes."
1886,I'm probably gonna need those. Huh?,"Hey, listen you ah...."
1887,Hmm?,...feel like getting a cup of coffee?
1888,"So umm, I'll see you tomorrow, huh?","Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight."
1889,"Wait a minute, wait. You're telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?!",Yeah! Oh my God! Is this what it's like to be you?
1890,"Wow, you're really crazy about her, huh?","Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we're on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart!"
1891,"Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.","Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?"
1892,,"Hey, Kate!"
1893,Morning.,"Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last week..."
1894,"Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute!","And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah..."
1895,"Hi, oh, I'm Lauren, Kate's understudy.","Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani."
1896,I know! I-I'm a big fan of yours.,What?!
1897,"I used to umm, schedule my classes so I could watch Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives.","Get out of here, really?!"
1898,Absolutely!,Yeah?
1899,"Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft.",They gave me the shaft all right.
1900,"Oh, you're so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?","Well Ahh, yeah! Yeah, sure, a drink sounds great."
1901,Cool! I-I'll see you then.,All right.
1902,,"Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?"
1903,"Hello. Oh! It's you. Just ah, just one-one sec. I am going to take this call. When I continue, I hope that there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call, committing to the moment!",That guy's like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?
1904,He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater you're dating.,"Hey, I'm not interested in her sweater! It's what's underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I'm going out with?"
1905,"I don't care. Why, do you want me to care?",Do you want me to want you to care?
1906,Do you?,What?
1907,,"Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?"
1908,"I can't believe we go on in, in a week.","Hey, it's gonna be all right."
1909,"Hey! So since we're getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs?",What?
1910,You know! At the place I told you about last night?,"Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah, y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight."
1911,"Oh, okay.",Okay.
1912,I'll see you tomorrow.,Okay.
1913,G'night.,"Ah, are you okay?"
1914,"Yeah, I guess. Look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh?",I don't know.
1915,"Well umm, maybe if it had more heat.",How do you mean?
1916,"Well, Adrian's looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor can't just kiss her, he's gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?",Maybe he could slip her the tongue.
1917,"Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up.","Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist."
1918,"And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach!","And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!"
1919,,Something like that?
1920,"Yeah, that's pretty much what I had in mind.",Yeah.
1921,,Hey.
1922,Hi.,Hey.
1923,Hi.,Hey.

1926,Oh my.,"Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming 'cause, 'cause her eyes keep going like this."
1927,,Hey.
1928,Hi.,"So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you ah, did you talk to Marshall?"
1929,About what?,"Y'know, about what happened with us."
1930,"Nooo. And there's really no reason he should find out, so ah let's not make a big deal about it, okay?","What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you. I-I was there, you're not that good an actress."
1931,"Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. That's all it was. Joey, I'm-I'm sorry you feel bad, but haven't you ever sleep with a women where it meant more to her than it did to you?",Nooo.
1932,"Hi, Lauren.","Hi, Lauren."
1933,,"Well, so anyway Beth, what I'm saying is I should've considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I've ah, I've recently learned what's it like to be on your side of it, and I'm sorry. So, do you think you can forgive me? Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. Hello, Jennifer?

1937,Yeah.,Saw a girl with that vest.
1938,"While most of us think of chocolate bunnies and baskets as traditional Easter gifts. Some people insist on giving live chicks as presents. Unfortunately, the sad fact remains that most of these little guys won't live to see the fourth of July. Because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead.","Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? 'Cause I was watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute!"

1941,Okay. It's a chicken.,"It's cute, huh?"
1942,"Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot's and lot's of love.","Oh, well no problem there."

1952,"I know what you meant!! You notice that ever since we got this chick, we've been fighting a lot more than we used too?","I don't know, maybe we weren't ready to have a chick."
1953,I'll take her back tomorrow.,Do you think we'll get our three bucks back?
1954,"Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think? This blue suit, or this brown one?","Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the blue one."

2139,"So, what do you say, Joey? You get the whole set of encyclopedias for twelve hundred dollars, which works out to just 50 bucks a book!","Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I'm home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there's a few things you don't get from book learnin'."
2140,"Well ah, what can you swing?","How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?"
2141,"You don't have, anything?","You wanna see what I got? Okay? I've got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!"

2146,,No he doesn't!
2147,I think so.,"Well, it's good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius."
2148,The volcano?,"Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation."
2149,What?!,"Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant."
2150,Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?,"Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?"
2151,,"Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?"
2152,Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.,I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
2153,"That's easy for you to say, you weren't almost just killed.","All right that's it, school is in session!"
2154,"Tribbiani! Hold on, I'll get the plunger.","Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you're gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord."
2155,And tell him what?,"Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry."
2156,Yeah. Well maybe you have heard about the Rent Stabilization Act of 1968!,I have actually not heard of that.
2157,"Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it. I've been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don't need this grief. I'm gonna call the landlord and tell him that Monica is illegally subletting here grandmother's apartment. Your friends are outta here pal.",Why don't you tell me something I don't know!
2158,Oh! My hero! What happened?,"Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he'd better come up here and apologize. I'll see you later."
2159,"What a minute, what did he say?","He said that he wasn't gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he's gonna do is have you evicted-I'll see you later."
2160,I told you not to go down there!,Well he made Rachel cry!
2161,"Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you've never sucked before!","All right! I'll try! But if I can't, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled."
2162,Go!!,"All right, all right, all right. I mean I'll have to check with him first, but I'll think he'll be cool with it."
2163,What?,"Please don't kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn't there fault, it was mine."
2164,You want me to kick you guys out instead?,"No you can't do that, where would the chick and the duck live?"
2165,You have pets!,"Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I'm the chick and Chandler is the duck."
2166,"Huh, I would've thought it was the other way around.","Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I'll do whatever you want."
2167,Really? You'll do anything?,"Yeah-yeah, absolutely."
2168,"Yeah, I've got something you can do.","What, what is it?"
2169,Can you be my dancing partner?,"That's not, prison lingo, is it?"
2170,His dancing partner?!,"Yeah, there's this superintendent's dance, the Super Ball. I don't know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he's a crush on."
2171,"Well, why doesn't he practice with a girl?","Well, he's too shy, he doesn't thing he's good enough to dance with girls yet."
2172,You're a genius!,"Aww, man, now we won't be bank buddies!"
2173,"Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.","Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I'm doing something exciting and I don't wanna get too excited, I just ahh, y'know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!"
2174,"Thank you, Joey.","No-no, thank you."

2176,"Okay ahh, well, just ahh, follow my lead.","Whoa-whoa, don't we need to do some kinda preparation first? Like ahh, get really drunk?"
2177,Ahhhh! I'm sorry!,"No, it's okay, but if I'm Marge, my breasts are coming out my back."
2178,"Ahh, forget it! I'll never be any good at this, my mom was right, I'm just a big potato with arms, and legs, and a head.","Come on man, you're not a potato."
2179,"I'm sure as hell a dancer, it's no use Marge will never go for me.","Come on Treeger, don't say that. You just ahh, you just need more practice. Here, come on, let's ahh, let's try it again.

2185,"Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes.","Hey-hey, hold on, this isn't some kind of like girly dance. All right, it's like a sport, it's manly!"
2186,"All right, then show me some manly moves.",All right.

2189,Yeah... Bunny-rabbit.,"So you ah, ready for our last practice?"
2190,"Yeah, but y'know, I think the reason we're not getting that spin right is because my apartment's too small.","Look, you wanna use our place?"

2197,"Right. Hey, ahh, you wanna come? Marge has a girlfriend.",Really?
2198,"Yeah, you could dance real good with her, she's the same size as me.","No, I'm good."
2199,"I'm sorry, you're right, I apologize, but I should tell you that I'm waiting for a date. Oh, and there he is now.",Hey!
2200,"Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey.","Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?"
2201,"Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.",Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.
2202,"It's fun, God I love how sexy I am.","Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters."
2203,,Hey.
2204,Really?!,"Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet."
2205,"99...100! Ready or not, here I come! All right, let's go over the concept one more time.",Hey!
2206,Hey!,"Hey guys. Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?"
2207,"Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.",It's 4:30.
2208,"Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.","Okay, I see what's going on here."
2209,You-you do?,Yeah! You don't like Kathy.
2210,You got me.,"Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?"
2211,Yeah. Right.,"Good, and hey! My treat. But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?"
2212,"Ohh, God, guys, check it out, you can see that girl's underwear!",Is she great or what?
2213,"Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer.",I'll be right back. What was that?
2214,What?,Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.
2215,"Hey, look, what do you want from me?","I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend."
2216,I am pretending.,"Well then, do it better!"
2217,"Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!","Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little."
2218,,"Hey! Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?"
2219,,Hey!
2220,Can I borrow the keys to your apartment?,Why?
2221,,You can pee here!
2222,"It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?","We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?"
2223,"Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.","Oh, I know..."
2224,"What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.","Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls."
2225,A pen.,It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?
2226,Huh-huh! You can't give her that.,Why not?
2227,"Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?","""Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... """"Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"""""""
2228,"All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?",She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.
2229,For three years?,"Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I..."
2230,"All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?","Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?"
2231,Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?,Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.
2232,,"So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?"
2233,You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?,Yeah.
2234,"Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! Here.","Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?"
2235,What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.,"All right, so... next time, you take her to your place."
2236,"No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.",What kind of smell?
2237,I don't know. Soap?,"All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?"
2238,Yeah.,"You wanna see her again, right?"
2239,Yeah.,So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!
2240,"Yeah, okay you're right.",Yeah.
2241,"I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?",Yeah!
2242,"It's, uh... it's endearing, really.",All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! Oink!
2243,Oh! Pathetic!,Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!
2244,Where?,"Our place, the hall! I..."
2245,I got something for her. It's a book!,A book? Is it like a book that's also a safe?
2246,"No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?","You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?"
2247,"No, it came out to an even twenty.",Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.
2248,,Hey!
2249,"Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?","Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now."
2250,Oh yeah? That's great!,"Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this!"
2251,Hey.,Hey!
2252,Thank you!,"You know, uh... Chandler got you a gift, too."
2253,No he didn't.,"Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!"
2254,"Oh, yeah... yeah.",Ah. Hm. Wanna go to bed?
2255,I'll be in in a minute.,"Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. ."
2256,Goodnight.,"Hey, that coupon expires, you know."
2257,Here you go.,"Great! All right, so I'll call you later."
2258,Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?,That would be Casey. We're going out tonight.
2259,"Goin' out, huh? Wow! Wow! So things didn't work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.","No, things are fine with Kathy. I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey."
2260,What?,Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
2261,Wait! You're going out with Kathy!,Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
2262,"Well, I'm upset-for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.",What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.
2263,"Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you.",You got all that from the back of her head?
2264,"All right look, I think it's time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.",Who's Elaine?
2265,I like it in the stern. ...of the boat. Hello.,"Hey, it's me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble."
2266,What happened?,"We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I'll be there as soon as I can."
2267,Why can't you tell her?,"'Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to-"
2268,Joey! Joey!!,Yeah?
2269,I thought your time ran out.,"Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more-"
2270,Oh the phone! The phone's making sounds! Hello!,"Hey dude, it's me."
2271,Hey it's Joey!,"Listen uh, I'm really sorry, it looks like I'm gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn't there!"
2272,What?,"Yeah, it must've fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog."
2273,Okay.,"Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize."
2274,,Aww man! I can't believe I locked myself out again!
2275,Hang on buddy!,Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
2276,I sure did.,Why?
2277,"Well, I just thought it'd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.","Well, you're amazing."
2278,Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.,"A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That's the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?"
2279,"Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.","Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had."
2280,"Oh, I don't know.","Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I'm gonna do that."
2281,You mean with Casey.,"No-no-no, I think I'm gonna see how things go with Kathy. She's pretty cool."
2282,Or Casey.,"No-no, Kathy."
2283,Could be Casey.,"No. No, Kathy."
2284,Consider Casey.,Y'know what I think? I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey. How 'bout I fix you two up? What do you think?
2285,Hey!,Hey! Samboucha Margarita?
2286,Is that a real thing?,"Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now."
2287,"Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.",What's up?
2288,"It's-it's about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.",You do?
2289,Yeah.,"Well, you're timing couldn't be better. She's not my girlfriend anymore."
2290,What?,"Yeah, she broke up with me."
2291,"Oh uh, when?","Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that's why I let people watch."
2292,"Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?","Well, I've been better. But, I'm all right. So you like her huh?"
2293,"Yes, but I-I uh, don't have too.","No-no-no, no it's uh, it's okay."
2294,Yeah?,Yeah. You know why? 'Cause you came to me first.
2295,"Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.","But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you're work cut out for you. 'Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she's into some other guy. So..."
2296,"See uh, that's-that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.",Who?
2297,It's me. I'm the other guy.,What?
2298,"Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and...",And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
2299,No! No! No! I just kissed her.,What?!! That's even worse!!
2300,How is that worse?!,I don't know! But it's the same!
2301,"Look, I'm sorry! But there's nothing I can do, I think I'm in love with her!",Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
2302,"You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.","Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!"
2303,Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!,"Is that why you bought all this stuff?! Well, y'know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there's a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I'm not gonna eat! You know why?!"
2304,Probably because...,"Because it's all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I'm not happy about you either. Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you."
2305,,Hello.
2306,,Hello.
2307,,Stop callin'!!
2308,"Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily challenge.",All right!
2309,Hey!,Hey!
2310,What are you doing?,I'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
2311,Everything? Even the TV?,No! I'm putting that in my room.
2312,"Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don't you think you could at least hear the guy out?","Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?"
2313,"That's a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?",Five years.
2314,You've sentenced him?!,Hey! Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
2315,"Joey, the guy's your best friend.","No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open."
2316,"Oh, who? Me?",Yeah!
2317,Wow! I'm honored! And y'know what I'm gonna do as my first act as your best friend?,What?
2318,I'm gonna get you to talk to Chandler.,All right. But if you weren't my best friend.
2319,"I walk into a room and he won't even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.","Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?"
2320,Hey Joe.,
2321,Hey! I'm sorry! That- where are you going?,My folks.
2322,"Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?",I don't know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
2323,What?!,"Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I..."
2324,"Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?","Look, it's not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya."
2325,"Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!",Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.
2326,"All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!","When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!"
2327,What?,"Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much! See you around!"
2328,"All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. What?",We've got a box.
2329,Yeah.,What's twisted?
2330,Me going out with Richard's son.,Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!
2331,Is he okay in there?,He's fine!
2332,"So now, what exactly is the point of the box?",Chandler?
2333,And Joey.,Hey!
2334,"Umm, well, he's...",He's doin' some thinkin'!
2335,What happened? What happened?!,You kissed my girlfriend!
2336,Gotcha!,That doesn't sound like thinking to me!
2337,Sorry!,Y'know I don't think you should be talking at all in there! I think you've got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!
2338,"You can't tell, but I'm trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!","All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you're just an idiot in a box!"
2339,"You're right, and I'm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won't say another word tonight.",So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
2340,Absolutely!,That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? Okay.
2341,,I'll get it.
2342,Oh.,Hey.
2343,"Hey. Listen, I want you to know how sorry I am...",That's okay. Chandler's the one I'm mad at.
2344,"Well, I'm still sorry. Is he here?",In the box.
2345,,Open the box!!
2346,What?!,"He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! Get out of there!"
2347,So?,"Yeah, we're gonna be fine! Get out!"
2348,Yeah?,"Yeah, you did some real good thinkin' in there."
2349,,Now go! 'Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you're secret Santa!
2350,,"All right, who got Chandler? 'Cause I uh, need to trade."
2351,He's taking her purse!,"Uhh, that's not them. I'm gonna go call the police."
2352,"Yeah, it's for our catering business!",I think I know that girl.
2353,"And also, we don't know what to do with this.","Oh yeah, I definitely know her."
2354,"All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?","Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?"
2355,"Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!","Well, why do you call him Gandolf?"
2356,Gandolf the wizard. Hello! Didn't you read Lord of the Rings in high school?,"No, I had sex in high school."
2357,Oh man! I am so excited-I may vomit!,"Will you calm down, he's just a human guy."
2358,"Look you don't understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y'know you're never know what's gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!",Really?!
2359,It's not gonna be exactly like last time.,"All right, I'll see you guys."
2360,Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!,"I have an audition, but I'll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon?"
2361,Somewhere maybe along the equator?,Okay.
2362,,Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you'd be out partying with Gandel-worf.
2363,"It's Gandolf, and he's not coming.",So you've been sittin' around here all mornin'?
2364,I can't believe he didn't come!,So what if he didn't come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
2365,"Yeah! We'd meet, we'd meet total strangers, and hang out with them!","Well, we could do that!"
2366,There's other stuff too.,"We'll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on!"
2367,Yeah!,Yeah!
2368,Yeah!!,Yeah!!
2369,It's not like we don't know how to party!!,Yeah! All right? Let's go!
2370,And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?,Yeah!!!
2371,,"All right, so we'll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we'll head back out."
2372,Okay.,"So, we're having fun, right?"
2373,Yeah.,"We don't need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we'll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing."
2374,"Actually, me too.",Are you serious?!
2375,Yeah.,Thank God! I'm exhausted!
2376,So you guys want coffees?,"Yeah, but uh, I don't want to be up too late, so uh, I'll have a decaf."
2377,"Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?","I can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad."
2378,How sad are we?,"Yeah, I know."
2379,"Y'know what? We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. Y'know? I'm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!",Yeah!
2380,Yeah!,Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
2381,"And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!","We're 29, we're not women."
2382,How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie? That joke would've killed in Albany.,"Done! I did it! Heh, who's stupid now?"
2383,"Well, believe me, it's been a long time since I've been flung.","Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas."
2384,I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.,Ohhh!
2385,"Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who's boss.","Hey, Mon! I'm not doing anything, why don't you fire me?"
2386,"That's a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?",Good enough to get fired.
2387,"All right, you're hired!",Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?
2388,"Hey! You guys, I'm writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?",Yes!
2389,I know but it's so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!,What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
2390,"Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and guys were throwing themselves at me! They're buying me drinks! They're giving me stuff! Knicks tonight?",Sure! Where are the seats?
2391,"It's a big company, I don't-if you-I...","Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?"
2392,"All right, I'm gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that?","Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!"
2393,You want a problem? I'll give you a problem!,"Oh, what are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?"
2394,"Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y'know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was-if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun, she's stupid, and kind of a racist.",Hey!
2395,"Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?",Damn!
2396,,Hey.
2397,Hey.,"Hey, what happened to your fancy chef's jacket?"
2398,"They baked it. I can't take this anymore. I'm gonna call a meeting tonight, I'm gonna fire you tonight.",You got it! Oh-oh!
2399,What are you doing?!,It's still a tiny bit on fire there.
2400,"Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?","Yeah. Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey. Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname."
2401,"Hey, dragon! Here's your tips from Monday and Tuesday.",There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!
2402,"A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!",No ma'am.
2403,What the hell happened?!,"""I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, """"Wow! It's been a long time since I had... 327 + 238 dollars!"""""""
2404,"Joey, we had a deal. That-that's why you're here! I've got to fire you!","And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don't fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you."
2405,What kinda things have you been saying?,"Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in."
2406,"I'm a good person. And I'm a good chef, and I don't deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y'know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is...",Hey! Chef Geller! Y'know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!
2407,You do?,"You bet I do! I just ah, wasn't listening then, that's all."
2408,Well if you want a problem? I'll give you a problem!,What are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
2409,,Well I guess I should've thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!
2410,Thanks.,Yep! Looks like it's gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.
2411,Enough!,Lean-lean-lean!
2412,,"Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! Guess which job I got."
2413,So what job did you get Joe?,"Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me."
2414,"Well, how can you be a tour guide, don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?","""No, not really. They give you all the information, it's uh, it's like memorizing a script. """"And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period."""

2424,That's just the way it is.,That's crazy.
2425,"Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now.

2428,I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.,"Look, Ross, really it's-it's no big deal. Y'know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can't be friends at work, then so be it. Y'know, hey I understand. Y'know? Hey, when I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right? So it's y'know, it's uh, it's cool. I'll see you tomorrow."

Ha-ha-ha-ha!""""""",That-that is a good trick.
2478,"All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?","Chandler, look they're actors. They're there to do a job, just 'cause they work together, doesn't mean they're gonna get together. I mean just 'cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them."

2480,"Oh-okay, I get the game now.","Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?"
2481,Oh yeah!,"Well okay, so then you're fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble."
2482,Really?,"Look, you guys have been to every play I've ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?"
2483,No.,Noooo!!

2496,"Oh, please!","Hey, how you doin'?"
2497,"Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.","Well, you gotta give him something that he can't say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you're guaranteed he'll say yes!"
2498,Really?! You think that will work?,"Absolutely! And if it doesn't, can I get the extra ticket?"
2499,,What the heck is that?

2502,"That's not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.","Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry."

2504,"Okay, it's ready. Come on.",What's ready?
2505,"Pretty much. So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?","I don't know, it looks the same."

What are you doing with your life?"""""""
2512,"Hey, Joey, I don't think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it's only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?","Look, there's nothing I can do for him right now, he's still in his sweat pants, that's still Phase One. Y'know? I'll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two."
2513,What's Phase Two?,Gettin' drunk and going to a strip club.
2514,Because there are naked ladies there.,"Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women."
2515,There are naked ladies there too.,Yeah.

2517,Catch any big fish?,"Oh my God, you guys have no idea."
2518,Are you kidding?!,"Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower. Plus! I fell in that big tub of worms at the bait stand! Hey, how-how's he doing?"
2519,He hasn't gotten out of that chair in two days.,Hey buddy! How's it going?
2520,,"Hey, see that? He just needed his pal to come home. All right, uh, I've got to go memorise my lines. Me and Charlton Heston bright and early tomorrow morning! Yeah-yeah!"

2528,What?,"Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice."
2529,"There's no way he smells, he's the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room.","Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?"
2530,"""The one with """"Heston"""" on it.""",Interesting.

2535,"Joey, right?",Yeah.
2536,"Every actor at one time or another-opp! Every actor thinks he stinks, even Lawrence Oliver at sometimes thought he stank, Bob Redford won't even watch himself.","Oh no-no-no, you don't understand..."

2550,"Well, I don't have to break up with her this time. We're not involved! I'm going to do a pre-emptive strike! I'm going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen!","Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. I'm tellin' ya!"
2551,Hey!,Hey! What's up?
2552,"This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don't work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.",I bet I stopped listening before you did.
2553,"Oh, just hold on a second. I'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don't know what the big deal is. I'm man enough to play this sport.","Dude, you're not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport."

2590,There's a Phoebe on my sandwich!,"Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!"
2591,I can't help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.,"All right look, y'know how-y'know how when you're dating someone and you don't want to cheat on them, unless it's with someone really hot?"

2638,"""No, I'm-I'm not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with """"The.""""""","""Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey's your pal. Joey's your buddy. """"Where is everybody?"""" """"Well, they're hanging out with Joey."""""""
2639,"Hey, y'know what, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. Oh, come on! Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and he's very loveable, once you get to know him.","Oh well, hey, Joey's loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there."
2640,"Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he'll be there. And he'll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you're really hot.",What do ya say? What do ya say?
2641,"Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names. But, all right, I don't-maybe I'll just name him The Hulk.",I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it! That's what I wanted to name my kid!
2642,Hey!,Hey!
2643,"Hey, they're going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y'know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful-didn't you see Personal Best?","No, but I'm gonna!"
2644,"So, I decided I'm definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.","Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler."
2645,Raymond Chandler.,Someone you didn't make up!
2646,"Okay, there are no famous Joey's. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.","Yeah, that guy really hurt us."
2647,"Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he'll never be President. There's never gonna be a President Joey.","All right look man, I didn't want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It's not even a name; it's barely even a word. Okay? It's kinda like chandelier, but it's not! All right? It's a stupid, stupid non-name!"
2648,"Wow, you're, you're right. I have a horrible, horrible name.","I'm sorry man, I didn't-I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
2649,Okay.,So I guess it's Joey then!
2650,,"Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in."
2651,,"Dude, I am sorry about what I said!"
2652,"No, no, you're right, it is a ridiculous name!",It's not that bad.
2653,"Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.","So, you're just Bing?"
2654,"Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.",No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
2655,It's Clint. It's Clint!,"See you later, Gene."
2656,It's Clint! Clint!,What's up with Gene?
2657,"Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?","Nah, you're not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney."
2658,Ha! Ha! Ha!,Ohh!
2659,I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!,Are you kidding? I love that guy! Morning's here! Morning is here-
2660,Okay.,"See, this is a great apartment."
2661,"Oh, yeah! You like 'em? I just, I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!","Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants."
2662,"""Uhh, a T-shirt that says, """"I don't belong here.""""""",You have Knicks tickets?
2663,Yeah.,Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor!
2664,Do you guys want these?,Yeah!
2665,"Yeah, what, do you think we're stupid?",You're not stupid. You're meaner than I thought.
2666,"No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.","Yeah, you do!"
2667,,Come on!
2668,Good one.,"Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?"
2669,"Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up the apartment.","Oh come-look, when I was a kid my dad's company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasn't in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!"
2670,"Hey, guys!",Hey!
2671,Oh my God!,We don't make enough fun of you already?
2672,"I like it, and Emily likes it, and that's what counts. So uh, how are you guys doing?","Oh-no, don't try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear."
2673,"Nothing! There's nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she'd have to uh, move here. She should move here!",What?
2674,"And I love the milk! But, I'm not gonna some British girl to move in with me! Joey, you say things now.","All right look, Ross, he's right. Emily's great, she's great! But this way too soon, you're only gonna scare her!"
2675,I don't want to do that.,"No! You don't want to wreck it, you don't want to go to fast!"
2676,No thank you.,"Wait-wait-wait-wait! Come on! Come on, let's trade! The timing's perfect, I just clogged the toilet!"
2677,"Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can't leave in the small apartment after we've lived here! Didn't you ever read Flowers for Algernon?","Yes! Didn't you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn't read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!"
2678,"Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.",It's the Knicks!
2679,Screw the Knicks!,Whoa!
2680,I didn't mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.,Huh.
2681,And the Knicks rule all.,"Yeah, the Knicks rule all!"
2682,"All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?",Done!
2683,Let me finish.,Oh.
2684,"I'm talking about a bet, winner takes all.","Ooh, we could end up with nothing."
2685,Or you could end up with everything.,"Ooh, I like that."
2686,"Op, op, I'm convinced!","Come on man, you know I'd do it for you! Because, you're my best friend."
2687,"All right, but you can't use that again for a whole year. I'm in.",All right!
2688,"Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh-oh, I have a game!",Okay!
2689,This is great!,What's the game?! What's the game?!
2690,,"Uhh, they're tall."
2691,"Oh, I have cards!",Oh.
2692,That's a low one!,"Yeah! Okay. Phoebe, you look, I can't."
2693,What make you think I can?!,Okay. Okay. Ace!
2694,Because we won our apartment back!,"What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!"
2695,"All right, cut, let's pick again, pick again.",Okay.
2696,Come on apartment! Come on apartment! Oh! I know queen is high!,"Uh-huh, not as high as... It worked! King!"
2697,"But, we pick again! We pick again!",Why?!
2698,Tickets please! That's courtside baby!,"Seriously, good game though. Good game. What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!"
2699,Those were like the best seats ever.,"Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y'know, kinda like a peace offering."
2700,"Oh. Oh, God!","Hey, want a beer? WHOA!!!!"
2701,"Well, you're gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we're switching it back! There's nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?",I don't know.
2702,What?,I don't want to move again!
2703,Totally worth it!,That was one good minute!
2704,Good night.,Good night.
2705,What-what's going on?,Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.
2706,"Oh, well, that's great!",Yeah! Yeah!
2707,Yeah.,Monica and Rachel made out.
2708,Hey! You're back!,Hey! Get into gear!
2709,I'll see you tomorrow morning!,Okay!
2710,Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!,Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!
2711,He's in a different room! He's really that loud?,"Oh, you should here me."
2712,"It's not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!","""Look, I told ya, I'm not going to any clinic! I don't have a problem, you're the one with the problem! You should go to a """"Quit being a baby and leave me alone"""" clinic!"""
2713,They don't have those.,"Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you've just had your first class!"
2714,"Y'know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over...","Ohhh, yeah!"
2715,"Next time you snore, I'm rolling ya over!","I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do it."
2716,"Y'know, whipped! Wah-pah!",That's not whipped! Whipped is wh-tcssh!
2717,That's what I did. Wah-pah!,You can't do anything!
2718,,This sucks! I didn't know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! I'm so tired!
2719,It's 6:00.,"Yeah, well..."
2720,"Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that's, I think that's really cool.","Yeah, Rach, I think you're handling that really well."
2721,Nothing.,I am... free!
2722,"Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married, but it's going to be torn down, so... I mean, I-I know it's crazy, but everything up 'til now has been so crazy, and I don't know, this just feels right. Y'know?",Hey! That's the day after I stop menstruating! This isn't mine.
2723,"Your name, please?",Joey Tribbiani.
2724,"Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot!","Yeah, she is. Wow! How you doin'?"
2725,,What?!
2726,"What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.",So why don't you give me your number?
2727,,Hey you guys! What's happening?
2728,What is that?,"Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it's gonna help me not to snore."
2729,"Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? 'Cause I don't think you have to wear it unless you are!",I know I don't have too! It tastes good.
2730,,Dude! I am trying to sleep!
2731,Y'know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.,I know. Ross is getting married.
2732,"Phoebe is, making people.",Everybody's doing stuff!
2733,"And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!",We could climb Mt. Everest!
2734,"No-no, not something stupid, something huge.","No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!"
2735,"Why not?! I mean it's just, it's just climbing! It's just, it's just steep!",Yeah!
2736,Hey!,Hey!
2737,What-what's up?,We're gonna climb Mt. Everest!
2738,"Yeah, well...",We could get that Everest video though.
2739,"Yeah, we could do that without y'know risking our lives at all!","And while we're down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! Oh, y'know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order."
2740,Yeeeeahhhh.,Yeah. Yeah.
2741,But I'll tell you something. One of these days we're get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!,Yeah we are!
2742,,It's never gonna happen.
2743,,"I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find..."
2744,,Don't answer that.
2745,,Awful! Horrible!
2746,She was not good. Not good.,She was nothing compared to you.
2747,,Ewwwww!
2748,"Ohh, this is soo amazing! I can't believe my brother's getting married! And in London! It's so romantic!","""Hey, pretty smart! Tissue paper! You're at the wedding, you have to cry, """"Handkerchief?"""" """"No-no, I got my invitation."""""""
2749,Hello!,Hey!
2750,Noo.,"Don't worry man, I get to bring a guest. We'll show him."
2751,I never knew that either.,"I knew that! I sooo didn't know that, but you should see your faces."
2752,Hey guys! What's up?,Heyyy.
2753,,"He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes."
2754,It is off. Right Ross?,Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
2755,"""All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that there's a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! """"It's almost as good as being there.""""""",It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear!
2756,"Well, You could, but... probably just the one time.","I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!"
2757,"If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.",Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
2758,Hey.,Hey!
2759,"So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?","Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, don't you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?"
2760,I sort've already asked Chandler.,What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!
2761,"Joey, I figured you'd understand. I mean, I-I've known him a lot longer.","Come on Ross! Look, I-I don't have any brothers; I'll never get to be a best man!"
2762,You can be the best man when I get married.,I'll never get to be a best man!
2763,"Oh no-no-no, you-yeah, of course you get to be my best man.",What about me?! You-you just said I could!
2764,"I'm not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!",I can't believe you're not picking me.
2765,"Fine, y'know what, that's it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.",Yes! Shame about you man.
2766,"It's not kicking me, it's kicking one of the other babies. Oh ! Don't make me come in there!",Hey!
2767,Hey!,Do you guys have like a big bowl I can borrow?
2768,"Yeah, there's one right under the cabinet.",Thanks.
2769,Why do you need it?,"Oh, we're having a big party tomorrow night. Later!"
2770,"Whoa! Hey-hey, you planning on inviting us?","Nooo, later."
2771,"What Phoebe meant to say was umm, how come you're having a party and we're not invited?","Oh, it's Ross's bachelor party."
2772,Sooo?,Are you bachelors?
2773,Nooo!,Are you strippers?
2774,Nooo!,Then you're not invited.
2775,All right fine! You're not invited to the party we're gonna have either.,"Oh-whoa, what party?"
2776,The baby shower for Phoebe!,Baby shower. Wow! That sounds sooo like something I don't want to do! Later!
2777,,"This is what I've got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor."
2778,Great. Great.,"Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I've got you, me, and Chandler and I'm gonna invite Gunther 'cause, well, we've been talking about this pretty loud."
2779,I'll be there.,"All right-oh! Listen, I know this is your party, but I'd really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there."
2780,"Yeah. Tell ya what, let's not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!",Okay! We'll need a six-pack of Zima.
2781,"Look, I gotta go pick up Ben. Everything so far sounds great Joey, just remember to keep it on the mellow side, okay? Just a couple of guys hanging out playing poker, no-no strippers or anything okay?",You got it.
2782,See ya. Have fun planning your mellow bachelor party.,"Well, there's gonna be strippers there. He didn't say anything about no strippers."
2783,"""He just said, """"No strippers.""""""","Oh, I chose not to hear that."
2784,"Hey listen man, about the stripper...",Yeah?
2785,Thanks for not marrying Rachel.,"Oh-whoa-wait, Gunther don't-don't forget your shirt."
2786,"Hey-hey, what are those?","Oh, little party favours, check it out!"
2787,Wow! Yeah!,Oh-oh!
2788,"Smooth man. Yeah, you got some chilie on your neck. Well, I just want to say, thanks everyone, this-this was great. And hey! See you guys Monday morning. Thanks Joey.","Oh, hey, don't forget your shirt."
2789,"Oh, thanks!","Okay, hey, museum geeks, party's over. Okay. Wave bye-bye to the nice lady. There you go. Back to your parent's basement. All right. Come on boys, come on out! Here you go. All right."
2790,"Ohhh, look at the little birdies! Are those yours?",Yeah!
2791,"Wow, I didn't know they let you keep chickens and ducks as pets.",Oh yeah-yeah. And I got the duck totally trained. Watch this. Stare at the wall. Hardly move. Be white.
2792,"You are really good at that. So uh, I had fun tonight, you throw one hell of a party.","Oh thanks. Thanks. It was great meetin' ya. And listen if any of my friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a Tuesday..."
2793,"Yeah, that would be great. So I guess umm, good night.","Oh unless you uh, you wanna hang around."
2794,Yeah?,Yeah. I'll let you play with my duck.
2795,,"Hey, stripper!"
2796,,"The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!"
2797,What?,The ring is gone!
2798,"Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this-Ah-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! You're the worst best man ever!","Dude, this isn't funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night, everything's cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper's gone and the ring is gone!"
2799,You slept with the stripper?,Of course!!
2800,,"Ugh! I don't know what I'm going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don't care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn't an emergency, then what is?"
2801,Hey!,Hey...
2802,"I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y'know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so...","So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that's nice!"
2803,"Yeah, right!","I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those..."
2804,"So you might say, it's a magic ring.","Yeah, the stripper stole it."
2805,"All right-all right, fine! I-I'm gonna call the cops!","Dude, I screwed up, you don't have to turn me in!"
2806,Not on you! On the stripper!,"Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they're gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders."
2807,"Okay, well, we'll call the company that sent her!","""I did that too! They wouldn't give me her real name or her number. They said, """"If I bothered them again they'd call the police."""" I said, """"If you talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring!"""""""
2808,"So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there's nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!","Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I..."
2809,"Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?","Oh, that sounds like fun, but we've got a ring to find!!"
2810,,"All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won't recognise you because, well, why would she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I'll be uh, Mr. Wong."
2811,What's he talking about?,"There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!"
2812,,"I don't get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn't take it, and I didn't take it; and you didn't take it, then who did? Shh! We're trying to think!"
2813,,If anything should happen to him...
2814,Joey! The vet said it's a simple procedure.,So! Things can go wrong! You don't know! What if he doesn't make it?!
2815,"He will, Joe.","Yeah, but what if he doesn't? He's such a good duck."
2816,,"I'm so worried about him, y'know?"
2817,Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much!,H-h-h-how's the duck?
2818,"He's doing just fine, he's resting now, but you can see him in a little bit.","Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this."
2819,"No, that's all right.","No, it's not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!"
2820,"Hey, come on, it's not your fault.","Yeah, it is! You wouldn't have lost the ring, right? Y'know what, Ross you were right from the start, he should be your best man."
2821,"No, you should.","Now, don't argue with me..."
2822,Really?,Really?
2823,Thanks man.,I gotta go check something over here.
2824,Six-hour trip to London. That's a lot of Monica.,What do you got there?
2825,"Condoms, dude!",How come the writing is in Spanish?
2826,,"It's all London, baby! Here we go."
2827,You got your passport?,"Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You don't want to lose that."
2828,,Ohh!!
2829,All right! Let's do it!,Woo-hoo!!
2830,"Yeah, cheerie-o!",London baby!
2831,"Okay, 'cause that's not gonna get annoying.",London baby!!
2832,"All right, let's go! Bye, Pheebs!","Bye, Pheebs!"
2833,,London baby!!
2834,,Come on! Do something!
2835,"I am, I'm ignoring you.","Okay, here! I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey."
2836,"Oh, what the hell is that?","It's London, baby! All right, the hotel's here. Wait. No, we wanna go... No. I know. I'm gonna have to go into the map."
2837,"Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!",I got it! Here we go.
2838,"Okay. Listen-listen, we're not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?","Shhh! Man, you made me lose it!"
2839,,"All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I've ever seen. Hey! Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?"
2840,"I think it's great. It's great. Y'know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place.",Really? To what?
2841,To Put the Camera Away!!!,"Man, you are Westminster Crabby."
2842,,Hey!
2843,"So, what are you guys in the market for? We've got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...",Check this out? Huh? Yeah. That's the stuff. What do you think?
2844,"""Well, I don't have to buy that, """"I'm with stupid"""" T-shirt anymore.""","Well, I like it. Here you go."
2845,"All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?","Oh, I embarrass you?"
2846,"All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.",Oh yeah? If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
2847,Good choice.,Thanks.
2848,,"How you doin'? Joey Tribbiani, America."
2849,,Hey.
2850,Hey.,Oh. Sorry!
2851,"No-no-no, y'know what? I really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn't cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day.",Me too.
2852,Yeah?,"Noo!! I've had the best day ever! Dude, check this out! Now, I'm gonna fastforward past the part with you, 'cause it is boring."
2853,Hey!,Sh-shh-shh!
2854,,"Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat."
2855,"Okay, so umm, what's your friend's name?","Oh, Chandler."
2856,Oh my God!,That's Fergie baby!!
2857,"Joey says you don't really like his hat, but I think it's kinda dashing.","So, I hear you're single now..."
2858,How did you? How? How?,"Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, I'm in my map and-and... Hey!"
2859,I'm gonna go to the bathroom.,Wait up!
2860,That was pretty intense huh?,"Yeah. Hey, I hope Ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!"
2861,Hello.,"Hey, Pheebs! It's Joey!"
2862,"Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the-that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say 'hi!' but then I figured, he doesn't care if he looks like you.","That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?"
2863,"Ohh, they're having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?","Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun."
2864,So you're not homesick yet?,"No, I don't think so."
2865,"All right, the seven of us miss you.",Who's seven?
2866,"Y'know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies...","Ahh, the babies miss me?"
2867,"Ooh, the pizza guy's here!",What? You ordered pizza without me?!
2868,"Yeah. But y'know we were thinking about you, y'know we ordered the Joey Special.",Two pizzas?!
2869,"Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.","Wait, well, where did you get it from?!"
2870,Sir?,What's in it?
2871,"Goat cheese, water chestnuts, and panchetta.","That's not food...No, I don't, no... Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my family. I miss the coffee house. I can't even remember what Phoebe looks like."
2872,"Joey, it's been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.",Your different here too. Your mean in England.
2873,"And I'm sure we're all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think, my friend getting married in Monty Hall. Ohh, come on!! Monty Hall!! Lets make a Deal!! Come on, you people!! All right, forget it!! Congratulations, Ross and Emily.","Hey, best man number two, Joey Tribbiani. Now I'm not good with the jokes like Chandler here. Boy...but ahh, I just want to say congratulation to the happy couple. I first met Ross in this coffee house back home...Home...New York City...Where everybody knows my name. Well anyway, I love you guys. But not as much as I love America. Could we please..go home now?"
2874,Are you going home? I was hoping to get to know you better.,"I'm not going anywhere, sweetheart."
2875,,Hello?
2876,"Hey, were the hell have you been?!",Hey. I spent the night out. I met this cute bridesmaid. She is so...
2877,I don't want to hear about her!!,"Ahh Pheebs, you know you're still my number one girl."
2878,"No! No, we have an emergency. Okay? Rachel's coming to London.",Ohh great!!!
2879,"No it's not great. No, she's coming to tell Ross that she loves him.","But, he loves Emily?"
2880,I KNOW THAT!!! You have to stop her!! She's going to ruin the wedding!!,Okay.
2881,"All right, so, okay...",Hold on. Hold on. Rachel coming. Do...Something.
2882,"Okay, so I'm done my part, okay. It's your responsibility now, okay. The burden is off me, right?",Right!
2883,,Do something..... Something....
2884,,Hey.
2885,Hey.,Have you seen Monica?
2886,I'm not seeing Monica.,What?
2887,What?,Look we've got to find her. Phoebe just called!! Rachel's coming to tell Ross she loves him!!
2888,Oh my god!,I know! That's why we got to find Monica!! You know where she is?
2889,You can let some of them go by!,"Pisst, Monica. Alright, we really need to start looking out for Rachel. I'll cover the front door. You watch that big hole at the back of the building and I got Chandler covering Ross."
2890,Why would I care where Chandler is? You know uhh...You know sometimes I don't even like Chandler.,Okay.
2891,Hello Joey.,"Hey, Felicity."
2892,"Umm, I thought about you all day.",Yeah.
2893,Um-hum. Talk New York to me again.,Fuggetaboutit. How you doin?
2894,Mmm.,"Oh, yeah."
2895,Joey there's a girl on the phone for you.,Ohh great!! Hello.
2896,"Joey, it's Phoebe. Did you stop Rachel?","No, but it's okay. She just came in and gave him a hug, that it."
2897,So nothing got ruined?,No.
2898,"Oh that's so great! Ohh, so what's going on now?","""Ah, I'm-I'm walking down the aisle...Still walking. I'm about to pass the bridesmaid I hooked up with last night. Hey! I told her """"Hey."""" And now I'm at the front with Ross. It's Phoebe. He looks pretty mad. Uh...I'd better go."""
2899,Okay.,"Well, that went well. Yeah."
2900,You've spoiled everything! It's like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!,"Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?"
2901,"Oh yeah, well who serves steak when there's no place to sit, I mean how are you supposed to eat this?","Hey, what's up?"
2902,"Hey, what's up?","You and me, next dance?"
2903,"Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!","Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count."
2904,But it absolutely didn't. It didn't!! It didn't!!,"Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so..."
2905,"Oh! Oh-oh, the band's ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says-I don't care about the stupid band!!",You spit on me man!
2906,"Look, I'm sorry.","Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?"
2907,,"Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!"
2908,"Well, I've got a girl in here.","No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!"
2909,"Well, we're-we're hanging out in here!","Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?"
2910,"Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's My Giant!",My Giant? I love that movie!
2911,,Can I ask you something?
2912,"Uhh, no.","""Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, """"I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant."""" Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?"""
2913,No.,"I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?"
2914,Yes.,Thanks man.
2915,Okay man.,But what about how much taller he is than me?
2916,,"I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?"
2917,,"Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour."
2918,I know!,"Had the beef-tips, huh?"
2919,Hey!,Hi!
2920,This pregnancy is throwing me all off.,"All right, I'm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck."
2921,"Oh, me too!","Why would you need to say hi to them, you've been feeding them for four days?"
2922,Okay.,"Well, that went well. Yeah."
2923,You've spoiled everything! It's like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!,"Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?"
2924,"Oh yeah, well who serves steak when there's no place to sit, I mean how are you supposed to eat this?","Hey, what's up?"
2925,"Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!","Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count."

2928,"Look, I'm sorry.","Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?"
2929,,"Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!"
2930,"Well, I've got a girl in here.","No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!"

2935,No.,"I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?"
2936,Yes.,Thanks man.
2937,Okay man.,But what about how much taller he is than me?
2938,,"I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?"
2939,,"Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour."
2940,I know!,"Had the beef-tips, huh?"
2941,Hey!,Hi!
2942,This pregnancy is throwing me all off.,"All right, I'm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck."
2943,"Oh, me too!","Why would you need to say hi to them, you've been feeding them for four days?"
2944,,"Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!"
2945,"I've had a very long, hard day.","Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?"
2946,"Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.",Okay.
2947,,You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?
2948,"For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!",All right!
2949,"Hey, Pheebs!",Mornin' Pheebs!
2950,"I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this driver...",Was his name Angus?
2951,What?,"Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London."
2952,"Uh, The Wheatsheaf.","Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh..."
2953,Hey!,"Hey, Ross, Bodington's!"
2954,Yeah!,That was good beer.
2955,Ohh...,"Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys."
2956,"Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.",Later!
2957,"Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I know that wasn't about me.",I bet it was about her a little.
2958,"All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.",Say that to him and you're golden.
2959,Hey!,"Hey, Pheebs!"
2960,"So, thanks for having me over! Rach. Pheebs.",See ya!! What the hell was that?!
2961,Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!,Havin' some trouble?
2962,Rachel locked the door.,I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.
2963,"Joey, I'm in!",All right. Good deal.
2964,Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!,"Uh, okay, Pheebs?"
2965,Yeah?,"Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?"
2966,Yeah?,"All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!"
2967,Central... Park!,"Yeah, all of us! All day!"
2968,"Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!",Phoebe!
2969,"Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?",Mine!
2970,Wait! It was my plan.,"Nooo, I said we needed a new plan."
2971,"And, I came up with Atlantic City.","Which, is the new plan!"
2972,,"Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking?"
2973,I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!,"Okay, uh Pheebs, quick. Look! This is for the babies to look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts?"
2974,"Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice. And then my mom wants to know--Joey, what are you doing?!",I gotta get the before shot!
2975,Okay.,"Oh! And so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee!"
2976,Hey! You okay?,"Ooh, something hurts!"
2977,"Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Ohh, that's so sweet!",Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.
2978,Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.,Oh my!
2979,They're male nurses.,Not in my head.
2980,"Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them.",Yep! There's always room for Jell-O...
2981,"Joey, how do you make that dirty?","Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, Grandma's chicken salad..."
2982,,"Ross! Get a shot of this. Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you were born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies... Check it out, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff."
2983,"Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?","Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them."
2984,Really? Male nurses?,"Yeah, I was bummed too."
2985,So they're going on dates? When?,I think Saturday-.
2986,Fine! Maybe I will too!,"Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop. Get up! Get up! Get up!"
2987,"Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones.","Umm, well, what else could it be?"
2988,It's kidney stones.,Or?
2989,Feeling a little better sweetie?,"Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up."
2990,"Kidney stones! Now, ordinarily Mr. Tribbiani, we try to break up the stones up with shock waves, but they're to close to the bladder now. Which means we can either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra...","Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up, up is not an option-what's a urethra? Are you crazy?!"
2991,,"Ohh, get these things out of me!"
2992,,"I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs!"
2993,I do too! I do too!,Argh!
2994,Argh!,Argh!
2995,,Oh my God.
2996,Would you like to see them?,They're so small!
2997,Why aren't you guys at the movie?,"Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!"
2998,I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!,He's talking to London!
2999,But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?,"Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her."
3000,"I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!",Ross! Way to suck up to the family.
3001,,Hey!
3002,"Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!","Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned."
3003,"Vomit tux? Who vomited on-y'know what, what you up to Joe?","Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!"
3004,Oh that's great!,"A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!"
3005,"Ugh, what's right with them?","Why don't you like PBS, Pheebs?"
3006,All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!,"I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies."
3007,"This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.","Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!"
3008,What-what are you talking about?!,"Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?"
3009,Yeah. So?,"It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry."
3010,Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.,"Well, may I ask for one example?"
3011,,That's because all people are selfish.
3012,Are you calling me selfish?!,"Are you calling you people? Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?"
3013,"Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?",That he doesn't exist.
3014,,How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
3015,This will be your phone.,"That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls."
3016,No you answer it and take pledges.,But I'm the host!
3017,"No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.","You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray."
3018,Hello.,Hey Mon!
3019,"Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?","See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure."
3020,You're not on TV.,"Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now?"
3021,"Hey, there he is! There he is!",Hello New York!
3022,,PBS telethon.
3023,"Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.",What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?
3024,"Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.","Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya."
3025,,"Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?"
3026,"Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man.",Come on man! You've been here all day!
3027,,PBS Telethon.
3028,Hi Joey.,Hey Pheebs!
3029,I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.,"$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?"
3030,"Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.",And you don't a little good about donating the money?
3031,"No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.","A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks."
3032,,Monica? What time is it?
3033,"Uhh, 9.",But it's dark out.
3034,"Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.",I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.
3035,Hey.,Hey!
3036,,"Doesn't seem like it's going to work, I mean..."
3037,"Hi, guys!",Hi!
3038,We're flipping Monica's mattress.,"So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it."
3039,"Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?","Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here."
3040,Condoms?,You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.
3041,Damn Rollos!,"Hey, you're back!"
3042,Hey.,How was your conference?
3043,"It was terrible. I fought with my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this?","Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?"
3044,Hi!,"Hey, you're back too!"
3045,"Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?","Hey, how was your chef thing?"
3046,Urghh!!,What are you guys woofing about?
3047,Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!,"Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!"
3048,You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do.,You want my advice?
3049,Yes! Please!,You're not gonna like it.
3050,That's okay.,You got married to fast.
3051,That's not advice!,I told ya.
3052,I'm going to the bathroom.,"Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it."
3053,Hi!,"Hi, Rach."
3054,"Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?","I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there."
3055,"Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.","Hey, you're not Kip!"
3056,Do you even know who Kip is?,Who cares? You're Rachel! Who's Kip?
3057,"Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.","Oh, that poor bastard."
3058,Hey!,"Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room."
3059,Yes that was mine.,'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
3060,Yes that would have made more sense.,"Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!"
3061,I know that too.,"Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something."
3062,,Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
3063,"Joey, can I talk to you for a second?",Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!
3064,,Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
3065,Yes. Yes.,You?! And-and you?!
3066,"Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!",How?! When?!
3067,It happened in London.,IN LONDON!!!
3068,The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.,But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
3069,,"All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but..."
3070,,"Aww, I don't want to see that!"
3071,,I guess I'm done.
3072,Uh-huh!,I think I'm gonna take-off.
3073,,"Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living under my roof!"
3074,What?!,"Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it."
3075,Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?,"Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about."
3076,,I can hear that!
3077,,I can still hear you!
3078,Hey!,Hey!
3079,Eeeee--ohh!! God!,"Argh-argh!! Ooh, soft. Is this mink?"
3080,I'll take it all.,"Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?"
3081,,"What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?"
3082,Now calm down Joey.,"No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!"
3083,"Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?","No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool."
3084,I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.,I'll take it!
3085,That might work!,"Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! Enh? All right, what do you think?"
3086,"No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden. No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye.",What's the matter Ross?
3087,"Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.",That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! Which is great! I love to ride that rail!
3088,,"Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? Ow!! He's not even here!!!"
3089,"Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!","Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?"
3090,Yeah!,"Yeah, you fogged Danny."
3091,Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?,"Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella."
3092,"I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.","Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing and it kinda knocked me out a little?"
3093,"I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.","Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?"
3094,"Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice...","You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!"
3095,Why?,"It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy."
3096,What's going on?,We all hate Emily!
3097,"No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.",Yeah!
3098,"Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.",Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!
3099,"Oh, I know.",I kinda feel like it's my fault.
3100,Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.,"Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!"
3101,Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.,"Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk."
3102,You're kinda stepping on the song.,"Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you."
3103,,"Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today."
3104,"You do, huh?","Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone..."
3105,What are you talking about?,I'm not sure.
3106,"Ross, I...",RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!
3107,"Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.","All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor..."
3108,"Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.",It's almost as if he knew.
3109,Hello everyone. So who am I saying hello too?,"Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here and that's Rachel!!"
3110,,I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling.
3111,How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!,"You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. Smile!"
3112,"Why, what happened?",What happened? What happened?
3113,Are you looking at naked tribe's women?,"No, look."
3114,That's a pig.,"I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her."
3115,What?!,Why?
3116,Who needs a lease when it's family!,"Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!"
3117,"Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!",Yeah.
3118,You got it.,Okay.
3119,,Ross?
3120,"Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.","Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't-I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine."
3121,"Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out. We will, we will, call you back!","Hey, all right!"
3122,,"You're fake laughing too, right?"
3123,,Hey.
3124,What are you doing?,Nothing.
3125,You built a fort didn't ya?,Kinda.
3126,"Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was","Dude, you should've gone out once and a while."
3127,I hate this thing!,"Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!"
3128,"Joey, please!",Sorry.
3129,,Ahhhhhhhhhh...
3130,Hello children!,Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?
3131,Okay.,"No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the boxes. Come on!"
3132,,"All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this?"
3133,Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?,"No, the quiet down thing!"
3134,You mean this.,"Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?"
3135,"All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!","All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game."
3136,No-no-no-no!,YES!!
3137,"Okay, so he's out of here.",Um-hmm.
3138,,Hey!
3139,Hey!,You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
3140,"Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!","Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!"
3141,"I don't know, clean places?","Umm, yum!"
3142,I'll take sports.,Mine!
3143,"All right. Uhh, international.",Oh that's mine too! I'm Italian!
3144,"Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.",But it's available now! Isn't it?
3145,"Yes, it is.","Hey, let's go look at it!"
3146,"Okay, let's go.",Okay!
3147,Let's go quicker.,Yeah!
3148,"Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.","Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place."
3149,"I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.","But hey, Ross, this place is available now!"
3150,"Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.",Yeah.
3151,"So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?","Oh, it's perfect!"
3152,We are bad people.,He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
3153,,"Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!"
3154,Yes that was a nice place!,Yeah!
3155,"Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!",Yeah!
3156,What are we gonna do?,I don't know. Maybe pizza?
3157,About Ross!,Oh! Oh!
3158,,"Hello! Oh yeah! It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references. Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable."
3159,"98. 99. 100. Okay, go!","Dude, I'm telling ya! I'm fine!"
3160,,Hey!
3161,"Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my application.",You're kidding!
3162,"Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while. So...","But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies!"
3163,"Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space.","Well, we got plenty of space! There-there's still some over there by-by that speaker. Please, just stay!"
3164,Are you guys sure about this?,Definitely!
3165,All right.,All right!
3166,All right! Isn't this a woman's hat?,"Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!"
3167,I couldn't possibly eat another bite.,I need something sweet.
3168,"Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.","Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having."
3169,"That's sweet, Joey.","Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs."
3170,,"I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?"
3171,"Oh God, no.","Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!"
3172,"Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.","Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories."
3173,What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!,"Hey, it's not like it sounds."
3174,,Hello?
3175,Hello?,Phoebe?
3176,Joey? What's going on?,Look.
3177,Oh my God!,I know! It's stuck!!!
3178,Easy. Step. How did it get on?,I put it on to scare Chandler!
3179,Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!,"Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here."
3180,"Hey, did you get the turkey basted-Oh my God! Oh my God! Who is that?",It's Joey.
3181,"Well, get it off now!",I can't! It-it's stuck!
3182,"Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. Joey? Now is not the time!",Sorry! Sorry.
3183,Arghhhhhh!!,"It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!"
3184,I'm over here big guy.,"Yeah, you are! I scared you!"
3185,You did look like an idiot.,"""Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, """"Butternut squash?"""" And it came out, """"Squatternut buash?"""""""
3186,"Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that.",You're a dork.
3187,,"Yeah, they're mine."
3188,Why are they here?,"I don't know uhh... Well, I'm Joey. Yeah, I'm disgusting, I take my underwear off in other people's homes."
3189,"Take 'em! Joey, you can touch them! They're your underwear.",Chandler? A word.
3190,,"That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop! Ahh! And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?"
3191,"Thank you Joey, thank you so much!","Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me! Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play. And one thing led to another and"
3192,"Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot.","Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't..."
3193,All this lying has been hard on us too.,"Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!"
3194,Help!,"All right! But, you do it with me once."
3195,Joey!,Didn't think so.
3196,"Hey, Pheebs!","Hey, Pheebs!"
3197,Hi.,What's wrong buddy?
3198,"Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?",I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
3199,"God, this was really fun! I've been wondering if you were going to ask me out.","So you uh, still wondering?"
3200,"No, we just went out.",You're smart. I like that.
3201,"Oh, candles! What is that? A blanket? A video camera? Oh my God!","Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!"
3202,I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date!,Hiya.
3203,,"I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films."
3204,,"You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!"
3205,Yeah.,"Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!"
3206,"No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your adult film class.","Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?"
3207,Oh-I don't know.,"Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!"
3208,"Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.","All right. Hey, but it better make me look really, really good. Oh, and another thing, the video camera? Nice!!"
3209,Oh my God! That's Monica!!,Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
3210,"All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!",No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just... I just... Kinda...
3211,,Thank you!
3212,Joey's a sex addict.,What?!! No I'm not!!
3213,It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!,No! No! I am not a sex addict!
3214,Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!,"No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!"
3215,What's going on?,I slept with Monica.
3216,You slept with my sister?,"Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London."
3217,"Monica, is this true?",Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
3218,"Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?",Ahh-oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
3219,Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?,"No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!"
3220,So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.,That makes sense!
3221,And the video camera?,"Uhh, Monica?"
3222,I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.,But sadly I could not be enticed.
3223,I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.,"Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs."
3224,,What are you doing?
3225,"I...Reorganized The Fridge. See, Bottom Shelf: Meats And Dairy. And Top Shelf expired products.",Why are you doing this?
3226,"Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I've already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.","Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You've got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven't you ever been unemployed?"
3227,"Hey, I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!","Hey, don't get religious on me, ok. A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here...sit down. Ready? Ahh!! Ohh, yeah!! Huh?!"
3228,"So what, we just sit?","Ohh, no, no. We're not going to just sit. Shhh."
3229,"Hello, Chandler Bing.",Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.
3230,"Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! It's been six months! It's not funny!","But, I love you."
3231,"Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!!",And that's Wednesday. Ohh.
3232,"You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular.","So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?"
3233,,How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italian actor from Queens.
3234,"Well, Telia Shire suddenly became available.",She's a woman!
3235,What can I say? She nailed it.,"Okay, is there anything else?"
3236,,That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
3237,"I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?","Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?"
3238,,"Wait a second, I could star in it!"
3239,Or that.,"I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it."
3240,"I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.",Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
3241,Yeah!,Thanks!
3242,"All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.",Done!
3243,And it can't be Joey.,It's not.
3244,Or Joseph.,Oh.
3245,,"Hey, how do you spell suspicious?"
3246,Why?,Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
3247,"Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.",You're driving me crazy with that!
3248,"Okay, I'll stop.",Don't stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
3249,,"Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now."
3250,You wanna play?,"Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule."
3251,"Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.","All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?"
3252,I'm intrigued.,"All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid."
3253,"Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.","Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts."
3254,Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?,"Uh yeah, right here."
3255,"All right. A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. That's it? Joey, you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident! And what is, and what is all this?! The official rulebook of Fireball.","Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing."
3256,This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!,"You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work."
3257,"And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work. Now come on!",Hey!
3258,Joey's not going.,I didn't finish my five pages.
3259,Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.,Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
3260,"I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.","Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played."
3261,I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!,"Come on look guys, don't fight."
3262,If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.,"Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!"
3263,...so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here forgets the camera!,"Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time."
3264,When did that happen to you?!,Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture-I didn't have my camera!
3265,"Okay, see? I told you!","Yeah, wow, sorry Rach."
3266,I don't believe they're brother and sister.,They're brother and sister!!!
3267,"Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.",Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!
3268,"Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! Last night!","No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!"
3269,Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!,"Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?"
3270,All right.,"""Okay. """"It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys are hanging out."""" Ross"""
3271,I'm sorry too.,"Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going."
3272,"I am sorry, Ross.","A handsome man enters. Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You, you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you well you co-created Fireball. The end."
3273,This took you all day?!,"No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball. Ha-ha!"
3274,,"Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out."
3275,I'm not reading this!,What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!
3276,Is there any entertainment there? What are people doing?,All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!
3277,We're very happy for you.,What's the matter?!
3278,"We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know...","All right, I'll take care of it."
3279,73! 72! 71!,"Ross! Ross! Ross, listen! Who are you kissing at midnight, huh? Rachel or Phoebe?"
3280,What?,"Well you gotta kiss someone, you can't kiss your sister."
3281,"Well, who's gonna kiss my sister.",Chandler.
3282,"Awww, man! Really?","Dude-dude, who would you rather have kiss your sister, me or Chandler?"
3283,That's a good point.,Yeah.
3284,"Oh well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.","Okay, great!"
3285,All right.,Pheebs! Pheebs! Ross wants to kiss you at midnight!
3286,"It's so obvious, why doesn't he just ask?","Rach! Rach! Listen, I'm gonna kiss you at midnight."
3287,So?,"So? Who would you rather have kiss you, me or Chandler?"
3288,"Oh, good point.",Yeah!
3289,"Happy New Year, Joey!",So did that do anything for ya?
3290,"""I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the """"new thing you do that day!"""" And it starts right now!""","All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar."
3291,Really?! How come?,"Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true."
3292,Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher.,Really? Who-who have you taught?
3293,"Well, I taught me and I love me.",Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!
3294,Nice!,"Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?"
3295,Horn-swoggle.,You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?
3296,"No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before.",Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet!
3297,"All right, see you later.","See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson."
3298,"Okay. Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the guitar! First you learn here, then you learn here.","Umm, okay."
3299,"I didn't! Even when I found out...umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.","Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out."
3300,"Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!","Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and..."
3301,"Did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? Did you?!",No.
3302,Give me your hands. Strings. Gimme it! Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?,Yes!
3303,I like 'em.,Yeah!
3304,"Okay, seriously, what do you think?",You look like a freak.
3305,No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.,"Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well."
3306,"Tiger! Dragon! Iceberg!! Joseph, did you even study at all last night?","Yes! Yes, I did."
3307,Then do Iceberg!,G-sharp.
3308,G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords? Have you? Oh my God!,What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
3309,"No, but you're questioning my method!","No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid! What?!"
3310,Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.,"Your other student, was you!"
3311,"Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!","Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher! Right here! Here! Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and THE KID'S GOT A GUITAR!!!!!!"
3312,,Hello?
3313,"Joey, it's Ross! I need some help!","Uhh, Chandler's not here."
3314,"Well, you can help me!",Okay.
3315,"Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom...",Nice!
3316,"No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I can't put them back on. I can't!","Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?"
3317,"Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder!","Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up."
3318,"Yeah, okay, hold on! They're not coming on man.","Umm, do you see any-oh, Vaseline?"
3319,"Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work?","Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there."
3320,,Ross? You okay?
3321,"They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!","Really?! Uhh, what color is it?"
3322,What difference does that make?!,"Well, I'm just-if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!"
3323,"Dude, what am I gonna...","Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out."
3324,"Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!","Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place."
3325,"Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!","What-what is it, what is it?"
3326,"Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.","Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!"
3327,"Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!","I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!"
3328,What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?,And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
3329,"I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone...",I'm not listening to you!
3330,,"Hey, Pheebs?"
3331,"No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!","Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready. You really think I'm ready?"
3332,Uh-huh!,Wow! Cool!
3333,Wow! Cool!,Was the chord at least right...
3334,That really is something; that's really cool.,Howdy partner!
3335,"Hey, uh, Joey?",Umm?
3336,Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?,"Oh, no!"
3337,"I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right?","Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!"
3338,"Yeah. Well. Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?",Now? You want me to go over there now?
3339,Yeah!,Do you know something?
3340,Do you know something?,I might know something.
3341,I might know something too.,What's the thing you know?
3342,"Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know.",I can't tell you what I know.
3343,Well then I can't tell you what I know.,"Okay, fine."
3344,,You don't know!
3345,"All right, how about I go over there and I will walk into Chandler's bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actually the thing that I think that I know!",YOU KNOW!!!!
3346,AND YOU KNOW!!!,"Yeah, I know!!!!"
3347,"Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have you known?","Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird about that! Listen..."
3348,"Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird about that! Listen...",Hey!
3349,,"Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain."
3350,Come on Joey!!!,"Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it."
3351,I can't believe you would say that!,Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
3352,"No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal! Fine I want-I need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?",I don't know.
3353,Is he romantic with her?,I don't know.
3354,Are they in love?,I don't know.
3355,You don't know anything.,"Ohh, I know one thing!"
3356,What?,They did it right there on the couch.
3357,,Hey Ross!
3358,Exactly! Because it's in the past!,Anybody gonna eat that?
3359,"I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in... Actually, thanks!",All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
3360,"Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.",Really?
3361,"Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.","Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff."
3362,"That's okay, Joe.","All right, let's go Pheebs."
3363,"I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.",Maybe we should check the trash chute.
3364,Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.,"That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there."
3365,You walked around all night in the city by yourself?,He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.
3366,"Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!",He hooked up!! Tell us about her!
3367,Ross! Janice?!,"All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind."
3368,So are you actually gonna see her again?,Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!
3369,I am gonna see her again.,Damnit Phoebe!!
3370,,"All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?"
3371,Uh-hmm.,All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. And they're off!
3372,Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!,"Judge rules, no violation."
3373,Hey!,Yeah!
3374,,What?!
3375,"You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We...",And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
3376,"No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!","Judge rules, Nutter-Butter."
3377,"Ohh, tough call.",Yeah.
3378,,"Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?"
3379,Sure! Why?,"Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate."
3380,,"Umm, hi."
3381,"I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just-I didn't know what it was!","Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her."
3382,Hey.,"Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat!"
3383,This would be the place where you explain the hat.,"Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff."
3384,And you're gonna make them all disappear.,"Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this."
3385,"Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out.","Great! Thanks, Rach!"
3386,"Sure! God, please take those off!",All right.
3387,Is everything okay?,Are you all right?
3388,"Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died.",Pheebs! Sorry!
3389,"Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.","Pheebs, I'm so sorry."
3390,"Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?","All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then."
3391,"Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.",Really? A purse?
3392,It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.,It looks like a women's purse.
3393,"No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. See look, men, carrying the bag.","See look, women, carrying the bag. But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man."
3394,Exactly! Unisex!,Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.
3395,No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.,"Well, I ain't gonna say no to that."
3396,,Hey!
3397,Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!,"What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!"
3398,"Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow.","Yeah, but sandwich time is right now."
3399,"Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.",Why would I return it? I love this bag!
3400,"All right, then you owe me $350.",Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard?
3401,Joey...,"All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you."
3402,"Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy.",U-N-I-sexy?
3403,"Hey, how are you holding up?","Hey Pheebs, I'm so sorry."
3404,"Hey, y'know what? My Grandma had the exact same bag!","Here, I brought you some flowers."
3405,,"Hey you guys, check it out. Check it out. It's like it's coming right at me."
3406,"Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!",What did you say to him?
3407,,Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?
3408,And a date with a man!,"Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey, comes with a bag!"
3409,"Any time you're ready, Joey.","Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink."
3410,"I'm sorry. Could you, could you try it without the purse?","Yeah, sure. Well, you must be new here. Maybe we should-I'm sorry, can I ask you something?"
3411,Sure. What?,"Well, first it's not a purse."
3412,"Okay, anytime.","I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's bag!"
3413,"Okayyyy! Anddd, go!","All right look, let me show you the catalog! See? Huh? It's the latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!"
3414,"Umm, do you sell these bags?","Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves."
3415,Okay! Thank you! That was great!,Yeah but I didn't read anything.
3416,I think we've seen enough!,"Okay! All right, I'll see ya. We got it! We got it!"
3417,,Hi.
3418,"Hey man, how did the audition go?",Estelle said I didn't get it.
3419,What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!,"Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me."
3420,What kind of problem?,"Well to tell you the truth, they uh, they had a problem with the bag!"
3421,Nooooo!,Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
3422,"Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.","I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach? Oh, you think I should give up the bag!"
3423,...I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.,I can't believe I'm hearing this!
3424,It would be so cool to live across from you guys!,"Hey, yeah! Then we could do that telephone thing! Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string!"
3425,"Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She might be able to do better.",Hey guys!
3426,Joey! Come here! Come here!,What? What?
3427,Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.,You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
3428,"Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?","Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!"
3429,"Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!","No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them."
3430,"Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.",I can't take any...
3431,No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!,Noo! I can't take any more secrets! I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!
3432,You don't have any secrets!,"Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal."
3433,"So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?",Ugh.
3434,,Yeah?
3435,Phoebe knows about us!,Well I didn't tell them!
3436,Them?! Who's them?,"Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey."
3437,Joey!,And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
3438,Oh man!,"I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!"
3439,Unless...,No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
3440,"You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.",I'm listening.
3441,"Yeah, he broke those too.",So he likes to break stuff.
3442,"I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.","Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming."
3443,"I can not believe he would do that to Mon-Whoa! Joey, do they know that we know?",No.
3444,Joey!,They know you know.
3445,"God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything!",I couldn't even if I wanted too.
3446,,"Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend!"
3447,He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.,Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!
3448,"Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.",Ooh!
3449,Okay!,"I like that! Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em!"
3450,"Joey! Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.",It's not my first time.
3451,"I just-I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!",Dude!
3452,God!,All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
3453,"Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.",Dude! He's right there!
3454,You were worried about me? You didn't know how I was going to react?,"Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business? Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister."
3455,Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!,I call Godfather!
3456,You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?,"Sure, if you cared enough to call it first."
3457,,"Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie."
3458,Hi!,"So, are you ready to go?"
3459,"Yeah, I just gotta run to the bathroom.","Oh sure, right back there."
3460,"Hey, where are we going to lunch?",I was thinking Chinese food.
3461,She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!,"I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but..."
3462,But what?,She keeps punching me.
3463,"In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?","Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay? She-she-she's hurting me."
3464,You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut!,"Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny."
3465,"No, you make them funny. You're the funny one!","Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat."
3466,"It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.","Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely."
3467,"Oh, no!",No-no.
3468,"Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.","Yeah, big!"
3469,,"Uh-oh, shht! The Misses."
3470,,Hey!
3471,"Hi! Wow! You look, you look...big.","Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?"
3472,"Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.","Well look, I'm breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?"
3473,Hi!,Hey! Hiya!
3474,"Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me.",Huh.
3475,Well? Aren't you gonna do something?,Uhh....
3476,"You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna?",Nah.
3477,Oh-no. No. No.,What a bad idea!
3478,Hey!,She's right y'know.
3479,,"Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?"
3480,"No, I will not!","Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it."
3481,That's not funny.,That's not funny at all!
3482,,Hey!
3483,Hey!,What are you guys doing up?
3484,"Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?",Dark red.
3485,"Yes, you are so smart!","Aww, you guys are so cute!"
3486,I know.,"All right, I'll see you in the morning."
3487,"Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!","Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed."
3488,"Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but...",Cat.
3489,Yes! You are so smart! I love you.,I love you too.
3490,"Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year!","Hey, you guys!"
3491,Hey.,"Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?"
3492,"Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?","Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I'm not him."
3493,"I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.",No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!
3494,Are you saying I smell bad?,"No! No, you smell like a meadow. I'm sorry."
3495,Hey.,Hey! Oh.
3496,"Hi, Joe.","Yeah, I didn't know you guys were going to be here."
3497,"Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this.",What?! Why?!
3498,What is going on with you?,Nothing!
3499,"Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!","All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream, but I don't want to talk about it."
3500,Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that? I kinda have a dream! I don't want to talk about it.,"Well, it involved Monica."
3501,"You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool! I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing. Anyway we're talking about your dream. I love you. Your dream?","Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish."
3502,What was the dream about?,"Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out."
3503,"Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn't mean that-that you're in love with me!",It-it doesn't?
3504,"No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.",That kinda sounds like your dream dude.
3505,"Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.",In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
3506,"Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?",Not really.
3507,"Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats! But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!","No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?"
3508,"Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?",Friends first? That's interesting.
3509,You become friends after?,"No, never done that either."
3510,What's up Joey?,How you doin'?
3511,"Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?","Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off, for you."
3512,Thanks!,"Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight."
3513,I know.,Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.
3514,What's up Joe?,"Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great..."
3515,Yeah?,"""...is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, """"Who are my friends?"""" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So..."""
3516,What are you saying?,I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
3517,"Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.",I'll treat you real nice.
3518,"Yeah, well, y'know umm... No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!",Won't-won't that take longer?
3519,"Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.","Yeah. I understand. I understand. Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!"
3520,,Hey!
3521,Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?,"Yeah, yeah, I met this woman."
3522,"Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?","Uhh, well, she's...really good in bed."
3523,"Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!","Well look, hey, it's all your fault!"
3524,What?! Why?!,"Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her! And her roommate!"
3525,What about the closeness?,Closeness-shmoshness! There was three of us for crying out loud!
3526,,"All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!"
3527,,"Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor?"
3528,N.Y.P.D!!,Oh my God!
3529,Oh my God!,"Uhh, just a minute officer!!"
3530,I know!,"Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!"
3531,Wh-what?!,"I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there."
3532,,"That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see me! Same as yesterday, same as the day before."
3533,Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?,"Nope. Op, wait! There he goes."
3534,,"Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me."
3535,"Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!","Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that. Okay, here goes. How you a-doin'? It worked! She's waving me over. Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor..."
3536,"Wow! She is pretty, huh?","Tell me about it, huh? Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica! Ewwuck!"
3537,Hey Joey! Great stuff huh?,This is your place?
3538,"Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can pretend to be surfing.","But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man!"
3539,,Ugh!!
3540,What happened?,"I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something. Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit."
3541,"Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!",Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair?
3542,"""Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? I even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, """"Well, yeah! If you've got enough life jackets!"""" Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh!""",What happened?
3543,"All right, we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me... Y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh...",You kissed him?!
3544,Yes!,"I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?"
3545,"What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?",Yeah! No?
3546,"Maybe. I-I don't know-Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!","Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on. She's back! Hot girl's back!"
3547,"Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.","No, in Ross's building! She's back! She's back! Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second. Got it!"
3548,,Damnit!! Did you move?!
3549,Yes?,Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
3550,No. I'm all alone.,"Yeah. Sorry about that. Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter by any chance a hot girl?"
3551,Daddy!!,Later! Oh man! Hot girl! Hot girl!!
3552,,Hey guys! What 'cha been doin'?
3553,Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?,"I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway."
3554,Why?,"Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something."
3555,"What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!","No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left."
3556,"No, those first two windows, that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.",I did not know that! Thank you Monica. I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.
3557,Sure. Joey...,Dahhhhh!! No! Noooo!!
3558,,"Okay, pick a card."
3559,Okay.,"All right now, memorize it. You got it?"
3560,Oh yes.,Is that your card?
3561,"Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.","Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town! Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!! I mean, way to go Ben! Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition."
3562,"I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings...",I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!
3563,"Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!",Luck!
3564,"Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.","Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month."
3565,"I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.",Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!
3566,Okay!!,Done.
3567,,They're gonna do it together.
3568,Dude! That's my girlfriend!,"What, so I gotta shut it down now?"
3569,Weirder than watching his two moms make out?,Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
3570,Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.,"Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather."
3571,You're not his godfather.,What?! Are you kidding?!
3572,"Of course I am! Okay, let's go godfather.",All right!
3573,,"Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!"
3574,Really? That's great!,"I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her..."
3575,"Hey, that kid looks familiar.","Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad...."
3576,"Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you,","That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?"
3577,"Joey, you look nothing like Ben.",I look more like him than you do!
3578,"Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!","Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback."
3579,You got a callback too didn't you?,Yeah I did!
3580,"Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?","Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so..."
3581,Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?,Who knows?
3582,Yes!! I knew it!! Bye-bye! So long! Later!,Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
3583,"Actually, that can't happen. Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So it'll be either you two or you two.","Man, this is gonna be kinda weird."
3584,"Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups. Oh, hi Joey!",Hey Pheebs! Hey!
3585,Hey!,"Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something."
3586,What's up?,"Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition."
3587,"Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.",That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!
3588,"Well, you just...","I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!"
3589,What?!,What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
3590,"Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.",At least I care about his feelings!
3591,What?!,Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn't get it?
3592,And why wouldn't he get it?,"Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!"
3593,Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?,You just give him a spoon baby!
3594,Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!,Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
3595,You're kid's name is Raymond!,Yeah?! So's yours!
3596,,"Hmmm, soup! Hmm soup! Hmm, soup!"
3597,"Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?","Oh yeah, no problem."
3598,Thanks.,"Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle."
3599,Joey!,Ross!
3600,,Hi!
3601,"Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready.",Uh-oh.
3602,Is there a problem?,"Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup."
3603,"""Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, """"Hmm, soup.""""""","Oh, what did I say?"
3604,"Hmm, noodle soup.",How's that different? Oh! Yeah!
3605,,"Hmm, noodle soup."
3606,Okay. Let's do it again.,Okay.
3607,,"Hmm, soup. I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!"
3608,Y'know what? We need to move on.,"No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look! Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit!"
3609,Hey!,Hey.
3610,"Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well.",Yeah right!
3611,"No really, I-I am! I feel bad!","""Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, """"Hmm, noodle soup."""""""
3612,"Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.",What you do mean?
3613,"I think, sub-consciously...","Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me."
3614,"I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.","Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor..."
3615,No!,"No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed."
3616,There you go. Thank you!,"Thank you! So, did-did he get it?"
3617,No.,"Eh, what are you gonna do?"
3618,See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.,"Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!"
3619,"So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!","Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English."
3620,"I'm sorry, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother. I've done it again.","She's my biggest fan. Yeah, she's the only one in the family that's believed in me."
3621,,"Yeah, I uh weighted like 27 pounds when I was born so..."
3622,,"Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?"
3623,,"Okay, see that blind guy right there? I'm gonna bash his head in later."
3624,,"Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up."
3625,"Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.",True story!
3626,Okay that is the one we already have!,"Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here! Oh my God."
3627,What?,"Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out."
3628,"Well, what is it?","Oh, they cut me out of the show."
3629,Maybe your scene's coming up?,Not likely. 'Cause you see that body bag right there
3630,Yeah.,I'm in it.
3631,"This is terrible, what are you going to do?","I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died."
3632,That's not good.,"No, smile! Not that face, smile! Everybody smile!"
3633,,"Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am!"
3634,No! Sam Waterston!,"No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me."
3635,All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.,"All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!"
3636,Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like ten minutes left!,"I know, I know! What am I going to do? Ooh!"
3637,No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!,"Yeah, all right. Ooh!"
3638,Yay!,Hey! Is the show still on?
3639,Almost over man.,Look! Oh! Is that the Pope?!
3640,Why am I looking?,"Oh, here I am, here's my big scene!"
3641,,All right back off! I gotta gun! I'm not afraid to use it!
3642,Oh Joey!,That's right!
3643,You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.,"Now, I wanna a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars. Choo! Choo! Choo! Filled with $100,000 in small bills, and if I don't get it... Choo!! And if I don't get it, I'm gonna shoot this duck!"
3644,Oh no!,I'm comin' out!
3645,,"That's uh, scenes from next week's show. Next week's!"
3646,"Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.","Oh, yeah, good idea."
3647,"Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow.","Ooh, Ross, look! Look!"
3648,What? Where?,Right over there! Right there! Look-look-look!
3649,What am I looking at?,Somebody help me out here!
3650,"Monica, I'm sorry I didn't come by last night. I was out with Gary; he let me ride around with him in his cop car. We saw and prevented crimes.",You got to go on a ride along?!
3651,Uh-huh!,I want to go on a ride along!
3652,"Okay, you guys free tonight?",Yeah!!
3653,,"Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich in the world!"
3654,Hey Joe does it have meatballs on it?,"Oh-ho, yeah!"
3655,Does it have melted cheese and marinara sauce?,Yep!
3656,"Yeah, you can't eat that in my car.",Yeah okay. Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.
3657,Your tax dollars?,"Yeah, okay."
3658,Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.,Did I say you could smell it?!
3659,I can't smell your sandwich?,Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!
3660,"Okay, I'll give them back. Look! What is so great about that sandwich?","Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had."
3661,Okay.,Are you thinking about Monica?
3662,Yeah.,"Yeah, what's that like?"
3663,"Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?","Come on man! Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?"
3664,"Yeah, no one talks like that!",Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
3665,Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.,"Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?"
3666,What? What? What? What is it?,Is everything okay?
3667,"Hey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire. Hey, look at that! You tried to save your buddy. You see that? You see what he did?",You okay man?
3668,"Uh, HELLO!!",Hi.
3669,"Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!","Yeah, I didn't know that."
3670,Bye!,Bye!
3671,,Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
3672,,Dude! How come you took off?
3673,"Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever...",Is something wrong?
3674,"No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.",Okay.
3675,You dove in front of Ross! Ross!,"That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!"
3676,I do not hate Ross!,Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.
3677,What picture?,"I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!"
3678,"Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!","Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I...knew...you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!"
3679,"When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.","Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich."
3680,From a bullet!,I know it doesn't make much sense...
3681,Much sense?!,"Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!"
3682,"So you risked your life, for a sandwich!","I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world!"
3683,"So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.",No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!
3684,Really?!,"Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, here."
3685,Thanks.,"No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!"
3686,,How good is that?
3687,"Oh-oi-ho, yeah!",See?
3688,Hm-hmm.,"Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!"
3689,I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.,Yeah. With a bite! Gee-e-e-eez!
3690,"Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.","Yeah, hero sandwiches."
3691,,"Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?"
3692,"Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island.",Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.
3693,,"Hey, what time is it?"
3694,2:17.,"Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?"
3695,Are you serious?!,Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
3696,Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!,"Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! Yeah, my pants are a little loose!"
3697,"Hey, you guys...",Hey!
3698,Is Monica here?,No.
3699,"Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?",Yeah!
3700,What-what is it?!,What the hell is that?!!
3701,"It's a, it's a cat!","That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}"
3702,ON A CAT??!!!!,It's not a cat!
3703,"Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}",It's not a cat!
3704,"Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?","Uhh, the ball thing."
3705,Yeah?,"Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!"
3706,"Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!",Okay!
3707,,Uh-oh.
3708,What?,I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!
3709,,"Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!"
3710,,Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
3711,Hey guys!,Hi!
3712,"Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. It was right here, where is it?",I don't know.
3713,"Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!","Oh, I don't know.... Yeah, can't do it."
3714,"Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!","Yeah, we haven't dropped it in..."
3715,I don't want a cat!,"Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat."
3716,Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?,That's right baby.
3717,He's a dropper!,"Oh yeah, that's right!"
3718,,"Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!"
3719,Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!,I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We invented this game!
3720,"Oh, thank God!",Did you get your money back?
3721,"Yeah. Yeah, I'll be alright.","Oh hey, here Pheebs."
3722,,Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
3723,,"Uhhh, mine too! Yeah."
3724,Chandler!,Me too! Me too! Me too!
3725,You okay there man?,"Yeah, I got too excited!"
3726,"""Uh, it's a piece of paper and it says, """"Ross"""" on it.""",Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what. I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!
3727,You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!,"""It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears... But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, """"Where's Betsy?"""" Right? And she says, """"Betsy's been dead for 10 years."""""""
3728,"Ohh-oh, chilling!","And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! And you know what that means buddy!"
3729,"Yeah, I know that means buddy!","Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!"
3730,"No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas.",All right! Thanks Pheebs!
3731,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?","Oh umm, not go."
3732,Oh hey Joey! What's up?,"I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?"
3733,"Yeah, I've been around.","Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?"
3734,"Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. {Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}",Great! Problem solved!
3735,But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.,"Well, back to square one."
3736,"Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.",Yes!
3737,"Good, but wait. Okay, all right, here we go. Now I want you to relax. Take a deep breath. Clear your mind. Which do you like better peanut butter or egg whites?",Peanut butter!
3738,Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?,A swimmer!
3739,Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?,"Monica. Oh... huh, I always thought it would be Rachel."
3740,No thinking! No thinking! Tie or ascot?,Ascot!
3741,North route or south route?,North route!
3742,Bamn! There you go! Huh?,"Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come!"
3743,"Oh, this guy again.","Hey man, what's up?"
3744,"Uhh, not much. You guys want to see a movie tonight?","Sure, what do you want to see?"
3745,"I don't know, umm...","Oh, I know how we can decide. Phoebe, show him your game!"
3746,What's with her?,"I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick. Okay?"
3747,Okay.,What do you like better action or comedy?
3748,Action.,Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
3749,"Dude, you are sick.","Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing."
3750,Hey!,Hey! You ready to go?
3751,,"Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!"
3752,"Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?","Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room."
3753,"I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?","Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket."
3754,So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?,"""Did you not hear the plot of the movie? """"She's been dead for ten years."""" I'm gonna be a millionaire!"""
3755,Hey!,Hey!
3756,"I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.",You got it!
3757,Bye you guys!,Bye-bye!
3758,Okay!,Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?
3759,,See ya!
3760,,"Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon."
3761,"We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once.","Don't worry, it's out there! I think I just need lunch."
3762,Yeah.,You wanna eat? My treat!
3763,Isn't that Ross's money?,Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?
3764,I don't know.,"Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!"
3765,Okay!,"Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?"
3766,Too dry.,"Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?"
3767,No!,Is this movie gonna be my big break?
3768,No!,What?!
3769,Yes.,"""Dude you said, """"No!"""""""
3770,"""I also said, """"Yes!""""""",You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?
3771,No! Ahhh!!!,I don't believe this!
3772,"Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.",What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!
3773,They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!,Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
3774,"Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.","Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone."
3775,"Oh, you don't want me on the trip?",Not if you're gonna be like this!
3776,"All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.",Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!
3777,"All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!",Fine! Get out!
3778,You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.,Get out!!
3779,Hello? It's Joey. I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.,Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!
3780,What did you do to his sweater vests?,Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
3781,"Hey, dude!","Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?"
3782,,Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.
3783,"Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down.",Wh-what?! Why?!
3784,"It's a money thing, we don't have any.",You're kidding right?
3785,No.,What?!
3786,"It-it's probably just temporary. We're hoping to get some more money soon, so if could just uh, hang out.","Uh, hang out?! How long?"
3787,"I don't know. A week? Maybe two? The money will turn up! People will always wanna invest in movies! Hey, you're not rich are ya?",No!
3788,"Hey pal, are you Joey Tribbiani?",Yeah.
3789,These got left for ya.,Thanks. Congratulations on your big break.
3790,Hello?,"Hey Monica, it's Joey!"
3791,"Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!","Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!"
3792,"Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?","Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!"
3793,,Sorry about that. Thanks for waitin'.
3794,Okay!,"Everybody smile! Okay, thanks a lot! Enjoy your stay at Caesar's! We hope it's toga-rrific! Kill me. Kill me now."
3795,,"Hey Pheebs! Listen, uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to my ATM card can, can you get it for me?"
3796,Sure! Where is it?,"Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner."
3797,Ohh! So you're 5639?!,That's it! Thanks Pheebs!
3798,,No! Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real!
3799,Who was that?,"Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes."
3800,,"Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Can you put him on?"
3801,,Don't come out here!
3802,,I got that! I forgive ya! Don't come out here!
3803,,"Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!"
3804,,"Uh, Entertainment Tonight. Yeah, okay so, good talking to ya and don't come out here. All right."
3805,Hey! Joey! Hey! Hey!! Wow!,Hi!
3806,Love your condoms my man.,What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
3807,Why are you dressed as a gladiator?,"Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break."
3808,Who are you talking too?,"They uh director. Uhh, her. All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here."
3809,Why?! What happened?!,"Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does."
3810,I'm so sorry.,"Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. I'm sorry man."
3811,So you're a gladiator! Wow!,"Yeah, what-what's going on?"
3812,Monica had lunch with Richard.,Dawson?!
3813,Thanks.,"Aww, there we go."
3814,Next time?,"Ooh, so close."
3815,Fine! Happy Anniversary!,Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big misunderstanding.
3816,What are you talking...,Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here!
3817,,"Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat."
3818,Really?,"Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right..."
3819,"Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.","All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today."
3820,Whoa!,"Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!"
3821,"Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick!","Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!"
3822,Good luck!,Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!
3823,,Can I change a hundred?
3824,Changing one hundred! Good luck sir.,Let's ride.
3825,13.,Hit me! Ohh man! Wait!
3826,,Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical hand twin!
3827,What?,My identical hand twin!
3828,What's an identical hand twin?,"What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!"
3829,Are you sure you weren't looking at your hands in a mirror?,Don't you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!
3830,How?,"Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!"
3831,"Again I must go back to, how?","This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand twice? Huh?"
3832,"Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.","Hey, are you unsupporting me again?"
3833,Hey!,Pheebs!!
3834,Yeah?,I found my identical hand twin!
3835,"No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on.",Hey-hey-hey you made it!
3836,Joey!!,All right! Hey-hey!
3837,Hi!!,Who's your friend? He's hot!
3838,"Hey listen I uh, talked to Chandler, sorry about the movie.","No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand twin!"
3839,Your what?,My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine!
3840,What?! That's not gonna make you any money!,"Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb."
3841,,"Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?"
3842,Which guy?,"He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this. See?"
3843,"I don't know about the hands, but the guy that was here before me just went to the bathroom.",Okay! How you doin'?
3844,Very busy.,Right! Okay.
3845,,"Oh-oh-oh, yeah! That's right, you take good care of those babies!"
3846,Excuse me?,"It's me, Joey!"
3847,Do I know you?,Joey!
3848,"Oh-ho, yeah. Yeah, the hand guy.","Okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?!"
3849,Nothing?,"Look, you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with it. Like-like, hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you know NASA's gonna wanna talk to us!"
3850,I have to get back to...,"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa! We could have our own show! Y'know we could clap our hands together people will love it! Huh? And-and-and I wrote a song for us! This hand is your hand! This hand is my hand! Oh wait, that's your hand! No wait, it's my hand!"
3851,That's okay.,But you haven't even heard the chorus!
3852,That must be our alcohol and beers!,Hey!
3853,"Ohh, I love Joey! Joey lives with a duck!",Hi!
3854,Hey!,"Look-look-look you guys, I need some help! Okay? Someone is going to have to convince my hand twin to cooperate!"
3855,"I'll do it. Hey, whatever you need me to do, I'm your man. Whoa-oh-whoa! Are you, are you okay?","Yeah! I'm fine! Thanks! Hey Rach, how you doin'?"
3856,"I'm doin' good, baby. How you doin'?","Ross, don't let her drink anymore!"
3857,,Ahhh!
3858,Are you gonna play?,"No-no, I don't really have any money. Not yet, anyway..."
3859,You can't sit here if you're not gonna play.,Ooh-ho-ho!
3860,14.,Hit me!
3861,Stop it!,"Uhh, Ms. Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at this table?"
3862,Please stop it!,"Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some type of a uh, entertainment venue?"
3863,"Please, please take him too.","Me?! Oh come on, man! You can't do this! Come on! I'm your hand twin!!"
3864,Oh my God!,Come on Pheebs! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
3865,Hey!,Hey!
3866,What are you guys doing here?,Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isn't that why you guys are here?
3867,Why else would we be here?,Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?
3868,,"Mornin' Pheebs. Well, my movie has officially been canceled."
3869,"Oh Joey, I'm so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?","Nah, I'm too depressed to eat. I'll probably eat in like 5 minutes. So I guess I'll just fly home with you guys, what time's your flight?"
3870,What about my cab?,I don't need that anymore.
3871,"No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.","I don't want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely. Oh-ooh! How about you come with me?"
3872,"I don't know, it's such a long trip.","It'll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be our chance to like renew our friendship."
3873,Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?,Sure?
3874,Hi!,Hey.
3875,"Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute.",Where is the waitress?! I'm starving!
3876,It's a buffet man.,"Oh, here's where I win all my money back!"
3877,"Listen, I gotta talk to you.",Sure! What's up?
3878,Monica and I almost got married last night.,"""Oh my God! That's huge! Wait a minute, why come I wasn't invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don't say, """"Ross."""" Do not say, """"Ross."""""""
3879,"Look, I just don't think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y'know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y'know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?",Oh! Tell her she's not marriage material.
3880,What?!,"Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she's anything like me, she's just gonna be relieved."
3881,No!,They let you get married when you're drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!
3882,"Laugh it up, but the joke's on you. Because we don't need to get divorced, okay? We we're just gonna get an annulment.",An annulment? Ross! I don't think surgery's the answer here.
3883,"Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. Come on Joey! You can't win if you don't ask any QUESTIONS!!!",What?!
3884,"Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We've been on the road six hours and you've been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!",All right. All right.
3885,Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio's broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.,Really? I don't...
3886,Sing!!,I wanna rock and roll all night!
3887,,"Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No!"
3888,"How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape-, a rapist or a killer or something!",Don't you think I asked him that before he got in?!
3889,I love the license plate game!,"Ooh, I'll play! I'll play!"
3890,"All right, see ya Pheebs.","Come on Pheebs! I can't take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!"
3891,Stop it! Stop it no! That's not fair! Y'know I can't resist that beautiful voice!,"Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn't deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you."
3892,You can still sleep at night and stuff.,"Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I've got a really good one! I've been thinking about it since Kansas."
3893,Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?,Yes.
3894,Is it a meatball sub?,That is incredible! You are the master!
3895,,What are you doing?
3896,The key's stuck in the lock.,I can fix it. Hold on. Look out. Look out.
3897,It still doesn't work.,I'm not finished.
3898,All right.,Hey Monica!
3899,Hi!,"Hey man, you feeling any better?"
3900,"Joey, we have something to tell you.",Oh my God! You're pregnant!
3901,"No-o-o! No? No-o-o! Look Joey, here's the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I'm gonna be moving out man.","Wow! Well, uh... Hey! I'm really happy for you guys! Congratulations! See you later."
3902,Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!,"Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. Like you'd believe that. This sucks!"
3903,"Look, I-I'm just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I'm moving right back in with you!","Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you're gonna be moving in with him I feel it's my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? He's a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm... Oh-oh he always, he always umm-Oh, who am I kidding! He's the best roommate ever!"
3904,,"""God, it's gonna so weird like when I come home and you're not here. Y'know? No more Joey and Chan's. No more J and C's. """"You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler's?"""" """"Can't, its not there."""""""
3905,"Look, I'm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.",Yeah but we won't be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
3906,Hey!,Hi.
3907,"I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don't I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!",Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It's like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie's!!
3908,,"So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?"
3909,"Oh we do, but not just yet.","Really?! Well, when?"
3910,"Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won't work out.",Wow.
3911,"I know. Then, I'm gonna marry Chandler for the money and you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.",Great!
3912,But then we ditch those two and that's when we get married. We'll have Chandler's money and Rachel's kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel's drinking problem.,"Oh-oh, what about Ross?"
3913,,Dude! What are yo-you trying to kill me?!
3914,"Yes, Denise. Denise!","Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?"
3915,Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!,"Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin' uh, I'm gonna have an extra room over at my place..."
3916,"Oh, that's true.","Yeah, why don't you move in with me? It'll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday's right?"
3917,,"Hey! Dude, some guy just called for you."
3918,Who was it?,"""I don't know! How about, """"Thanks for taking the message."""" Jeez!"""
3919,,"Hey, what's up?"
3920,"Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.","But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today."
3921,"""""""Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly."""" Nice!""","Yeah? I just figured y'know, after living with you it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y'know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who's different than me. And what's more different than me; a guy who's not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? Not just a hat rack my friend!"
3922,,"Everything on your application looks really good-Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?"
3923,"Oh don't worry, I'm not really a party girl.","Whoa!! Now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?"
3924,You can call off the roommate search! Hi! I'll be living here.,"Oh don't listen to him, he's just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don't think he's gonna get it."
3925,Why did you take the shower curtain down?,That thing was a hazard! I'm very safety conscious.
3926,"Yeah, I'm-I'm sure. Yeah, get out of here before I change my mind.","Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?"
3927,I've been back and forth.,"Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it you're right where you don't want to be! Back together!"
3928,"Ehh, I don't, I don't think so. She's already talked about y'know, dating other guys.","""That's not gonna work out! Then she's gonna come home all weepy and you'll be tellin' her, """"Oh that's okay. You'll find someone."""" And then, bamn! She finds you!"""
3929,"Yeah, well, m-maybe you're right.","I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want?"
3930,,"Here she comes. Hold on, I'm gonna make your life much easier."
3931,"All right, well the place was closed. I'll just copy it later.","Or not. Uh, Rach, why don't you just move in with me?"
3932,"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!","No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no... It's okay, I mean I-look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday's thing, but we don't have to do that!"
3933,"Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you're thinking about Naked Wednesday's.","Thursday's clearly not good for ya, pick a day!"
3934,,Hi!
3935,Hi!,"Come in. Thanks for comin' back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!"
3936,Great!,"Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I'm gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind."
3937,I can do that.,Okay! Here we go. Pillow.
3938,Fight.,Very good! Okay. G.
3939,String?,"Excellent! Okay umm, doggy."
3940,Kitten?,"Ooh, sorry! No-no-no, so close though, but-bye-bye!"
3941,Phoebe that's crazy!,I can't believe she would say that too you.
3942,"""""""...subcategories. The first of these subcategories is...""""""","Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?"
3943,No! Why?,"Well, I've just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn't have naked chicks on it."
3944,"Some uh, some visual aides.",Oh-ooh-ooh! Y'know what's a good visual aide?
3945,Please don't say naked chicks.,Why not?!
3946,Hey.,Hey! Any good mail?
3947,"Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor's Guild.","Ooh, it's probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I'm kinda...."
3948,"""""""Benefits lapsed.""""""",Hmm that's weird. I don't remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
3949,"Okay, it's not a check. They're saying your health insurance expired because, you didn't work enough last year.",Let me see that!
3950,All right.,"Oh, I can't believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y'know? And it wouldn't matter. Now I gotta be careful?!"
3951,"I'm sorry man, there's never a good time to stop catching on fire.","All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I'm gonna go see my agent."
3952,"Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.",...look both ways before you cross the street.
3953,,"Hey Estelle, listen..."
3954,Well! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back huh? They think they can do better but they all come crawling back to Estelle!,What are you talkin' about? I never left you! You've always been my agent!
3955,Really?!,Yeah!
3956,"Oh well, no harm, no foul.","Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance."
3957,"All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.",Why?
3958,"Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.",Bastard!
3959,Hey!,Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I'll have my health insurance back in no time.
3960,"That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now?",What?!
3961,What's wrong with you?,"Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven't been able to stand up since. But um, I don't think it's anything serious."
3962,This sounds like a hernia. You have to-you-you go to the doctor!,"No way! 'Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!"
3963,That's a hernia.,Why did I have to start working out again? Damn you 15s!
3964,"Hey, will you grab me a cruller? Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!","Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it's getting darker and more painful, that means it's healing."
3965,I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing...pushed back in.,"Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don't want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I'm thinking I'll probably start with that laser eye surgery too."
3966,Hey.,Hey!
3967,"Oh Joey's got a really bad hernia, but that's nothing a little laser eye surgery won't fix!","Look, I'm telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here it doesn't hurt that bad."
3968,Hey! Maybe you'll die!,"Sure, now I'm scared."
3969,"No, we can go together! Just don't wait too long though, okay? 'Cause I'm outta here sometime before Friday.","Yeah, but I don't wanna die!"

3972,,So that's why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today!
3973,That's where you pick up the bag.,Exactly.
3974,"No, the line is pick a bag, so you need to pick up the bag.","Or, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah, Purina One, point to a bag today. I didn't get it, did I?"
3975,No.,"Yeah, okay."
3976,,Hi. I'm Joey Tribbiani; I'm here to audition for man.

3984,Uh sure.,Okay.
3985,Action!,"""""""Take good care of your Momma son."""""""
3986,Have you really done this before?,"Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You just take a big, big swing. Now, don't hold back. and Phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)"
3987,Hey!,Hey-hey-hey!
3988,,"Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys. Ooohh, to a Porsche! Hey Gunther, these yours?"
3989,"Yeah, that's what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!",Na-uh! Hey did anybody lose their keys?
3990,"Joey, why don't you put them in the lost and found?",There's a lost and found? My shoe!
3991,You left a shoe here?!,"Well, I didn't realize until I got home. I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y'know what? I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield."
3992,"Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.",Great! Thanks.
3993,Nice car!,"Yeah, it's not mine."
3994,I love your car.,"Yeah, it's mine."
3995,I bet it's fast.,"Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?"
3996,Yeah!,It's got 'em!
3997,Yeah? Well this is not what I ordered.,Hey guys!
3998,Hey!,"Hey babies! Oh, I'm having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche I've got the keys too, still there!"
3999,Shocking! Since you still have the keys.,"You should see the treatment I get when I'm with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments."
4000,What equity investments?,"The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they're gonna start to think that I don't own it. So I figured I'll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?"
4001,,"Yeah, she tops out at 130."
4002,Wow!,And that's just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.
4003,Really! You got a place upstate?,Sure!
4004,"Well, I'll see you later.","Okay, take it easy."
4005,Hey! That's my car.,"Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it."
4006,What-what are you doing?,"Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I'm just polishing her up."
4007,But it's my car!,"Yeah, but it's my wax."
4008,"Listen, I-I-I don't come to this city much so I don't know if you're crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could I have my keys.","Sure. Here. I'll uh, save your parking spot."
4009,I'm not coming back.,Why not?
4010,I live upstate.,"Yeah, so did I."
4011,,So the Porsche guy took his car back.
4012,But you found the keys to his clothes?,"No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche."
4013,And people will think you own a Porsche because you're wearing the clothes?,Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn't have the car! Right?
4014,"Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.","Oh, I've been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche."
4015,"Joey, you know you don't actually have one.",Come on! What are you doing?! I'm in character! Would you talk to her!
4016,,Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche?
4017,Maybe because you've got the keys?,Porsche.
4018,That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!,Hi! How are the Gellers?
4019,The judge wouldn't let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?,Hey! It's Porsche!!
4020,,Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!
4021,Hi Joey.,Hey! How you doin'?
4022,He has the most amazing Porsche under there!,"I'd love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She's sleeping. Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink?"
4023,"Okay! Listen, I'm gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.",Right! And when is that due?
4024,First of the month.,And that's every month?
4025,"No, just the months you actually want to live here.",Ahhh.
4026,"Okay, here is the phone bill.",Oh my God!!
4027,"That's our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don't I just-why don't I just cover you for a while?",No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...anymore.
4028,"It's not charity, Joe...","No! Forget it! Okay-I mean thanks, but I'm done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what's next? Come on."
4029,"Okay uh, here's the electric bill.",This is how much we pay for electric?!!!
4030,,Hey!
4031,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.","I don't know Ross, not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist."
4032,Why not?,I've got Ben.
4033,,Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.
4034,"Oh, I wish I'd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.","Oh that's okay. Hey, actually in a way it's kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!"
4035,"Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?","What, are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once since my injury plagued '97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money."
4036,Yes it would. What do you say to $50?,"Okay, you're on."
4037,,Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That's like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! $500 that is a loooot of electricity! Whoo-ho-ho! I gotta buy some food.
4038,"Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.",You serious?
4039,Oh yes!,"Okay, get ready to owe me!"
4040,Okay.,"Okay, here we go. Ready?"
4041,Still broken?,"This sucks man! The last night you're here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500."
4042,"Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?","Nah, not my game."
4043,"Okay, uh, how about, how about-y'know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it's fun.","Well, what's it called?"
4044,Cups.,I don't know how to play Cups.
4045,"I'll teach ya! Come on, come on, it's really easy and really, really fun.",All right.
4046,"Okay, here you go. I have two queens, what do you have?",A two and a five.
4047,"Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!",Really?!
4048,"Oh yeah! Okay, let's play again. What do you got?",A four and a nine.
4049,You're kidding right?,No. Why?
4050,Well that's a full cup!,Damn! I am good at Cups!
4051,You win.,"Well, what did you have?"
4052,"It doesn't matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?","Uh, wow, 700."
4053,Not 700 exactly?,Yeah.
4054,Double it!,What?
4055,"Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.",Really?
4056,,Hey!
4057,What's wrong?,"Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!"
4058,Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!,"The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin' Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothin'!!"
4059,Oh man!!,"And he never played before either! Y'know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups."
4060,"All right, let's play one more hand! One more!","No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I'm serious this time! In-in fact, look, there's a-I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y'know, thank you for being such a great roommate."
4061,I can't take the big white dog! You love it!,"It's him, not it!"
4062,"No, but wait-what if I bought it from you, y'know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say $1,500?","Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! You-you're trying to give me money again!"
4063,When did I try to give you money?,"""Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said """"No,"""" you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!"""
4064,I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay.,"I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. Okay? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I'm gonna miss...is you. And now the dog."
4065,,"Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my new roommate!"
4066,Hi,"Yeah, she's gonna live with me!"
4067,Lecroix. Janine Lecroix,"I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!"
4068,"Australia, I just moved here a couple of weeks ago.",From the land down under? I didn't know that either!
4069,I'm a dancer.,You're a dancer? She-she's a dancer!
4070,"Well, I think I'll go and unpack.","Oh, hey let me."
4071,"Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?",Of course I did.
4072,"Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?","""""""When can you move in?"""""""
4073,"Hey, look at all the boxes!","Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!"
4074,"All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?","Oh God, yeah."
4075,Now imagine you live at the supermarket.,Okay!
4076,No-no,"Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!"
4077,"Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.","Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt."
4078,"Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.",You a little sad about that sweetheart?
4079,"OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. Joe? Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack.",I Gotcha!!
4080,Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.,"Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!"
4081,"Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica's gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?","I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer."
4082,"Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?","Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. How you doin?"
4083,,Ohhhh man
4084,"Sorry, there's just more room out here.","No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need to do my stretches too."
4085,Why don't you try to do-,
4086,What's wrong?,Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm all sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower. Oh my God!
4087,"Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!","Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! What the hell's going on over here?!?!? Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time."
4088,,"No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?"
4089,That's not specific to girls.,"This is great, this is great, what else, what else?"
4090,"Hey Joey, I got some beer for you.","""Uh, don't you mean """"for whom?"""""""
4091,"Sure, listen I was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one?","Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh."
4092,Is there something wrong?,"All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road."
4093,Joey...,"No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?"
4094,"Well, I don't think there is anything to do. I mean I think you're really sweet, but I'm just not interested in you like that.",Oh!
4095,"No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.","Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on."
4096,I don't think so.,"Oh, I do. How you doin?"
4097,I'm OK,What?!?!
4098,What?,Oh dear God!
4099,,Hey.
4100,"Hi, my name's Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?","Sure, neighbor come on in."
4101,"So, is Janine around?","Uh, no, she's at dance class."
4102,Can I check out what she did to my room?,"Yeah, but, hey look, don't go through her stuff. She gets really mad."
4103,"Oh my God. What is th... it's like a guy never lived in here. Look, you've got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. It's spreading already.",It is???
4104,"Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?",No.
4105,"Is that your tiny little box, that's too small to put anything in?",No.
4106,"No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, you're going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.","All right, you're right. I'll talk to her."
4107,Yes talk to her. Be a man.,I'm a man.
4108,Defend yourself.,Hmm.
4109,Maybe it's a universal thing?,"Or maybe, it's because you're hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday."
4110,Hey Joey.,"Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Do you, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?"
4111,"No, I just thought it was cute.","Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.. Okay, uhh...Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. It's...too girly."
4112,Ohh. Like what?,Like this. Pictures of cute babies we don't know. We..we can't have that.
4113,"Joey, it's Anne Geddes. She's a famous artist.","Look I don't know this baby. I don't know if she's a famous artist or not. You know, and I don't want to be a jerk but you're changing too much around here."
4114,"Well, I'm sorry. I just thought I'd try to make the place a little nicer.","Yeah but it's too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can."
4115,Well I just thought...,"I'm sure it's a famous watering can, okay. But, come on...and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?"
4116,It's a curling iron.,"Ohh, well, that's ok then. But, okay my towels for instance. I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. It's up here on some hook..and...smells different."
4117,It's clean.,"Yeah, well, it feels different."
4118,It's dry.,"Alright, I can make my peace with the clean dry towels...Also what is with these chips you bought?"
4119,"No no no no, it's potpourri. You're supposed to smell it.",Well that's like summer in a bowl.
4120,,Hey Chandler. Come on in. We're knitting pot holders.
4121,,"So what's really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer."
4122,"Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I'm going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.","Ohh, I love birds."
4123,What is the matter with you ?!?,What?
4124,"You're arranging flowers! You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!","Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they're just, you know, they're nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby."
4125,You're turning into a women.,No I'm not. Why would you say that? That's just mean.
4126,Now I've upset you? What did I say?,"It's not what you said. It's the way you said it....Oh My God, I'm a woman!!!"
4127,Hey.,"Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you."
4128,What's the matter? Are you upset?,"I'm sorry but we've got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That's just the way it has to be."
4129,"Well, if that's what you want. I'll just put it all in my room.","Great...Great...and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn't want to make a big deal out of this, you know. You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to."
4130,Okay.,"And, uhh, maybe the watering can there."
4131,Sure.,And a couple of these little tiny boxes.
4132,Joey? Do you want me to put it all in your room?,Okay.
4133,"This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.","Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin' up, eh?"
4134,Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.,Well maybe I love ya'.
4135,Are you guys going to Chandler's for Thanksgiving?,"Yeah! Yeah, why? What's up?"
4136,"No, but you should go to Chandler's. Because none of us knows how to cook, we'll probably just end up drinking all day.","Ye-ye, we go to yours!"
4137,,"How you got three women to marry you, I'll never know."
4138,,Hey!
4139,Hey!,"Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!"
4140,And the place looks so nice!,"Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!"
4141,Happy Thanksgiving!,"Well, this has been great!"
4142,And who else is going to be there?,"Uh, some of her friends, yeah."
4143,Her dancer friends?,"Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they're gonna be, be drinkin' and dancin, and we really wanna go!"
4144,"Oh, but-but it is, uh, it's just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.","Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!"
4145,,"Rach, you're killin' us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!"
4146,"""The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y'know, I thought """"well, there's mincemeat pie,"""" I mean that's an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y'know. Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?""",Y-sure!
4147,And while I'm gone don't you boys sneak a taste.,Okay.
4148,,"I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?"
4149,"Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!",Chandler!
4150,"Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd's Pie!",Oh man! Now she's gonna start all over! We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
4151,"No, no, we will. We just won't tell her she messed up.",Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
4152,"Yeah, it'll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!",Vomiting stories are funny...
4153,"Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!",Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?
4154,No!,Still not hot enough!
4155,,Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine's friends are dancers?! And that they're going to be drinking alot!?
4156,"No, I did, but tell me again, because it's so romantic.",Well you're whippin' so slow! Can't you do it any faster?
4157,"So why don't you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?",Oh I am!
4158,,Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
4159,,"Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert."
4160,"What?! What is with everybody? It's Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!","Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they're all gonna' make fun of her, do you want that?"
4161,"Okay, okay, we'll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie!","Dude, they're not objects."
4162,,"Just kiddin,' I'll talk to them, you distract Rach."
4163,,"""Oh and Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach or uh, or saying """"mmm"""" and uh, oh oh! And smiling , okay?"""
4164,,"Rachel, there you are! Come on, let's serve that dessert already!"
4165,"Joey, you're gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don't get any dessert.",Really?
4166,It tastes like feet!,I like it.
4167,Are you kidding?,What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.
4168,I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle!,I wanna gooooooo!
4169,"Well actually, I-I didn't eat mine. It's still in the bathroom.","No it isn't, I ate that."
4170,Well we left ours in Monica's bedroom.,"Nope, got it and I got yours too."
4171,,Hey you guys.
4172,Hey Joe what's up?,"I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y'know, everywhere I look she's like..."
4173,I can see why that's hard to resist.,I like her so much!
4174,"Aw, I'm sorry sweetie that she doesn't feel the same way.",I know. And she's so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.
4175,Well they said I should bring someone. Do you wanna be my dance partner?,Totally! I would love to spend New Year's with you.
4176,Bye Janine!,Did she just ask me out on a date?
4177,"Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I'm sorry, but I don't think that was a romantic thing.","Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We're going to a New Year's Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y'know? But if she says 'Dude, what the hell are you doing?' I can say 'It wasn't me, it was New Years!'"
4178,,"OK, listen I've been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It's a show, but we're just dancing, OK? It's no big deal. The important thing to remember &#150; stay cool."
4179,"Uh, yeah. Now you guys dance over there, you guys over there, and I want you two right around here, and everyone else spread out.",Ross! So when is it gonna air?
4180,Hey! You're a good dancer!,Really?
4181,"Yeah, well you'd be better if you just loosened your hips a little.",What do you mean?
4182,"That's it, feel the rhythm. That's better.",Uh-huh.
4183,"Okay, you're dancing with that girl over there.",No-no-no-no-no we came together!
4184,"I don't see it. You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand!","No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot."
4185,,Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. Here we go. Looking good Gellers!
4186,,"Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you're dancing with."
4187,"She's nice, huh? To think I almost brought my wife to this!","Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown &#150; I'm trying to win her over, so I was wondering if.."
4188,No I don't think so.,"Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she's real, uh, mellow!"
4189,"Look, are you dating this girl you came with?","Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know..."
4190,"No, no. She's fair game if you ask me, sorry buddy!","Alright, alright, hey y'know fair is fair, if you're right, you're right, what can I say, but hey oh no!"
4191,"God! What are you, in second grade?","Hey, now you're the one who wet his pants."
4192,What's going on over here?,"Uh, take a look at the guy's pants! I mean, I know you told us to show excitement, but don't you think he went a little overboard?"
4193,What's the matter with you? Get out of here!,"Yeah, take a hike wetpants!"
4194,Alright we're back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven!,"Okay, it all comes down to this. Whatever happens, happens. Destiny."
4195,Cut!,No! Year! Happy No Year!
4196,,"Home sweet home, huh? Nice to, uh, get back to reality. Plus we know how the New Year's gonna go off. I guess there's no reason for all that Y2K panic, y'know? Anyway, g'night!"
4197,Joey.,Yeah?
4198,"3, 2, 1. Happy New Year.","Oh, yoii. What was that for?"
4199,"Well, I don't know tonight when they yelled cut and we didn't get to kiss, I was really, really, disappointed, and I just, really wanted to kiss you","Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment."
4200,"In the moment, yeah.",But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?
4201,"Sure, New Year's Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait?",No.
4202,Me neither.,"3, 2,"
4203,"Joey, you don't have to count down every time we kiss.","Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready."
4204,,Hey!
4205,Hey!,"Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?"
4206,"She's made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.","Well all right then, I guess I shouldn't get to excited about the fact that I just kissed her!"
4207,You kissed her.,Oh we kissed it up real nice.
4208,"So you kissed her, so what happened after that?",I came over here to tell you guys.
4209,I gotta go.,Okay.
4210,I'm gonna be really late for dance class!,Okay.
4211,"Okay, now I'm really late.","Okay, I'm all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips?"
4212,Bye.,Have you kissed her yet? It's awesome! I could do it forever! Y'know what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!
4213,"Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.",I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed!
4214,You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!,I was tired!
4215,"It's gotta be one of a kind. Y'know like umm, y'know uh, what's that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?",Hey! I made that for her!
4216,You made pottery?,Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
4217,Yeah.,And Chandler I can't believe I let you pay for this one. Thanks man.
4218,Oh that would be great!,"Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine."
4219,"Joey, you don't have too!",Nope-op! I insist! You get the wine right?
4220,"Yeah all right. Okay, good night guys.",See ya tomorrow!
4221,How are we gonna get out of that one?,What?
4222,I can't handle two nights in a row with them.,What-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
4223,"I don't know, they're just a little blah!",Blah?!
4224,"Well y'know, he's blah, she's just-she's very loud for such a small person.","Uh, they're like my best friends. Are you saying we can't hang out with them? 'Cause that would kinda be a problem."
4225,"No! Of course we can still hang out with them. Just y'know, not two nights in a row. Okay?",I guess.
4226,Thank you.,"If you want, I'll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents."
4227,Hey!,Hi!
4228,"And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn't afford it, because you paid dinner last night.","Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it's just gonna be me again tonight."
4229,What happened to Janine?,"Oh, she's uh-uh really sick."
4230,Oh that's too bad.,"Yeah, she's been in there all day , uh high fever, a nose problem... Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!"
4231,Monica! Chandler! I'm really-really sorry about tonight. I don't know if Joey told you; I just couldn't get out of going to this play. I'm sorry. Have a great time.,'Kay!
4232,,"No-no, she really is sick!"
4233,Then why-why is she going to a play?!,"Uh, y'know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold."
4234,Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!,"Well uh, she didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I'm so sorry."
4235,"Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!","Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud."
4236,"And I am not blah, I am a hoot!","I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don't-don't be mad. I'm sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y'know? And it was our first date! Plus, she's really sick!"
4237,"No, you sh-No you said you made that up!!","I know, but don't you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?"
4238,"Eh, they're both good. I generally just go with, Monica's drunk again.","Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? She'll come around I promise."
4239,I do not like that woman!,I can hear you!
4240,I know!!!,Hey!
4241,Hey.,"So uh, what are you guys doing?"
4242,"Oh nothing, we're just talking. Y'know, blah-blah-blah.","Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine."
4243,"Well, I'd like to but, I'm not sure we have time to go.","Ha-ha, very funny-Look! I don't know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!"
4244,We owe you?!,"That's right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!"
4245,We didn't give you any money!,You don't think I know that!
4246,,"Well, this-this-this was great. Didn't everybody have a great time?"
4247,Oh good.,"Oh well then, good night!"
4248,,"See? Eh, wasn't that fun?"
4249,All right! You and me! Let's go! Right now!,All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine!
4250,You'd better hope I don't see you in the hallway!!,"All right, uh, we've got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you can't treat them that way."
4251,"They said stuff to me too, y'know!","I know! I know! And I'm going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They... They're like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I... I don't think we can be together. It just, it just can't work. It can't. I'm very upset."
4252,"Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?",Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah.
4253,Did you hear that?,"Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?"
4254,"Yeah, I'm sorry man. You wanna go watch?",Yeah!
4255,Hey!,How ya doin'?
4256,"Hey so, did uh, did she move out?","Pretty much, yeah."
4257,I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.,"Well, when it's not right, you know it."
4258,You okay?,Yeah! Yeah. I'll be all right.
4259,Y'know what would cheer you up?,What?
4260,"I'm giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come.",You're right! That did cheer me up!
4261,"Yeah, I guess.",Hey guys.
4262,It's my joke.,"Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?"
4263,"Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.",Let's go watch it at your place.
4264,"Nah, Monica's watching some cooking show. Come on, I don't want to miss when they were skinny.","Chandler, Chandler, y'know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses."
4265,"What? No, I want to watch this. . Did your cable go out?","No, that's VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . It's like a lotta noise to me. I don't know..."
4266,"Joey, why is your cable out?","I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven't really paid the bill"
4267,"If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?","No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot."
4268,Whoa ho.,"I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book ."
4269,"All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?",Sure.
4270,Paid your phone bill?,Not so much.
4271,,You forget how many great songs Heart had.
4272,"So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.","Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I'm not even sure I got it."
4273,Here you go.,"Ah, Gunther, I can't pay for this right now because I'm not working, so I've had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin' for stuff."
4274,"Well, if you want, you can work here.","Uh, I don't know. Ya see, it's just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y'know? And to go from that to this, I just... Plus, I'd have to wait on all my friends."
4275,"Okay, but the money's good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.",What?!
4276,Flexible hours.,Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?
4277,,I finished my book.
4278,,"Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, 'cause I'm heading up there."
4279,"Uh, yeah, I'll take a coffee. Thanks, man.",Sure. Coffee? 'Cause I'm going up there.
4280,"No, thank you.","You guys need anything, 'cause I'm heading up there."
4281,I'd love an ice water.,You got it.
4282,"Joey, what are you doing?",Just being friendly.
4283,"Joey, honey, I don't think you're supposed to go back there.","Nah, it's okay. Right, Gunther?"
4284,Don't wink at me. And put on your apron.,"Okay, but I don't see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons."
4285,"Joey, do you work here?",No.
4286,"Hey, waiter.",Yeah?
4287,"Joey, what's going on. What didn't you tell us you work here?","It's kind of embarrassing, y'know. I mean, I was an actor and now I'm a waiter. It's supposed to go in the other direction."
4288,So is your apron. You're wearing it like a cape.,"I mean, the job's easy and the money's good, you know? I guess I'm going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys."
4289,"Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?","Okay, I guess it doesn't seem that weird."
4290,"Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven't gotten it.","See, now it's weird again."
4291,"Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. A smile goes a long way. And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.","Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y'know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It's all about turnover."
4292,"Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?","Oh, I'm sorry, Ross. I'll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I'll toss in a free muffin."
4293,,"Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition."
4294,"No, I'm leaving to get my hair dyed.","Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it's a great part. Look, check it out. I'm the lead guy's best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. 'I'm sorry, that seat's saved.'"
4295,That's the whole part?,"Okay, maybe he's not his best friend, but ..."
4296,"Okay, I'll see you in an hour.","Oh, man, I could totally get that part. 'I'm sorry, that seat is taken.'"
4297,"Oh, excuse me.","No, no, I didn't mean you. But, you believed me, huh?"
4298,I believed you were saving this seat for someone.,"So, you'd hire me, right?"
4299,For what?,"Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour."
4300,Huh? What?,"Yeah, it's for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It's a very important issue in this month's Playboy. I'm sure you all read about it."
4301,"Hey, buddy boy, how'd the audition go?","Not good, no. I didn't get the part, and I lost my job here, so ..."
4302,How-how did you lose your job here?,"Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me."
4303,"He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you've been working here two days? That's not, that's not right.","Yeah, what are ya gonna do?"
4304,"That's right, he can have his job back. I'm glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.",That's great. Thanks Rach.
4305,No way.,I'm not answering that.
4306,,"Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together that's $12.75."
4307,Hi!,Hi!
4308,How much do I owe you for the muffin and the latte?,Oh that's on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
4309,"Oh great! Well, tell him thanks. And since uh, Joey seems like such a nice guy, maybe we could go on a date sometime?","Well, he's not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I good check with him-He says it's okay. Great! Thanks! Bye-bye!"
4310,"Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn't free?",It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I'm getting more dates than ever!
4311,Yeah Joey that is so gross!,How about a scone on the house baby?
4312,"And that's Phoebe , and that's Joey.","Hey, how you doin'?"
4313,,Are you all finished here?
4314,Yes.,Great!
4315,"Okay, here are the tips for this morning. Jen gets 50, 50 for me, and Joey owes eight dollars.",What?!
4316,For all the free food you gave away.,"Well if it's free food, how come you're charging me for it?"
4317,We don't give anything away unless it's someone's birthday.,"Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?"
4318,No!,Sorry!
4319,,That'll be $3.85.
4320,What do you mean? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay for stuff!,"""It's just I can't because my manager said I... """"Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Annie..."""
4321,Amy!,"""""""...Amy! Happy birthday to you!"""""""
4322,"Hey, that's weird, today's my birthday too!","Yeah, not it here it isn't."
4323,,"""""""Happy birthday to you!"""""""
4324,You're paying for that.,What? No-no it's her birthday!
4325,You've sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!,But it really...
4326,You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins.,Damnit!
4327,"I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all we've been through, I just-y'know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.","Oh-ho, and mine!"
4328,,"Oh, uh, hey Rach. I uh, I was just coming over here to uh... Oh wait, I don't have to lie to you, you don't live here anymore. Uh, I'm eating their food. What are you doing?"
4329,Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.,"Whoa, I didn't know we could date your sister!"
4330,Yuck!,I can't believe Ross went out with Rachel's sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.
4331,That was like 5 years ago.,Yeah you got 5 years left!
4332,Joey...,You wanna make it 6?!
4333,"Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!",You didn't cry when Bambi's mother died?
4334,"No, I guess I just never really cried. Y'know? I'm not a crying kind of guy.","Come on man there's gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?"
4335,"I'd be sad sure, but I wouldn't cry.","""Okay, what if the puppy said, """"Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me."""""""
4336,"No! Look, I don't cry! It's not a big deal! Okay?!",No! It's not okay! It's not okay at all!! You're dead inside!!
4337,"You're just saying that because you're my biggest fan. Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay? He's a fan. Bye!","So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?"
4338,"I have no idea what you're talking about. But I, but I just got Phoebe Buffay's autograph!","Oh, you're Phoebe's fan!"
4339,Oh yeah! I've seen all her movies.,Movies?
4340,"That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.",I don't think so.
4341,"No-no, it was! She was in Sex Toy Story 2, Lawrence of Alabia, and I got her autograph! The guys at the comic book store aren't gonna believe this!","Hey Gunther, don't let that guy in here anymore! He just said Phoebe's a porn star!"
4342,Oh great! Did you get a movie?,"Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don't think it's the kind you're gonna like."
4343,,Sort of...
4344,"Guys, what's going on?",Phoebe's a porn star!
4345,That's Phoebe! Where did you get that?,Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.
4346,"Yes, but you are dead inside.","All right well, I'd better take that back."
4347,"Wh-what, why?",We can't watch that! I mean that's Phoebe!
4348,Probably just the first half.,"No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe's our friend! Well, I'm not gonna watch it!"
4349,Yeah! Good for you Joe!,Yeah.
4350,She's just doing her job!,You sick bastards!
4351,,Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!
4352,Hey!,Hey!
4353,"So, I just came from the company Ursula works for.","Oh no, not you too!"
4354,No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay's checks; there were a lot of them.,Nice!
4355,"Um-mmm, and I won't have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.","That's great, but isn't it gonna bother that people still think you're a porn star?"
4356,Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.,You do?
4357,"Yeah. You're trying to figure out where you know me from? All right, I'll give you a hint. From porn! Okay? Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! See?",Yeah.
4358,Wow!,What is the matter with you?!
4359,No! Barry and Mindy.,"Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. Who-who's Barry and Mindy?"
4360,Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.,"Ohh-oh, wasn't he cheating on you with her?"
4361,"The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian.",I can't. I keep seeing it the good way.
4362,"No, I just think Monica was that fat.","Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! Oh-hey, there's Carol again!"
4363,,"So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?"
4364,"Yeah. Y'know, the hazelnut actually not a nut, it's a seed.",Wow!!
4365,Can anyone else name a well known seed that's been masquerading as a nut?,"Oh dear God, let me think."
4366,Hey.,Hey.
4367,Was his question what's more boring than him?,"Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?"
4368,"Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.",Really?
4369,"Maybe Joey doesn't have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?","That's an idea! Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?"
4370,"No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!",That's great! That would be great! Let's do that!
4371,I could use the money; it could give me time to write.,Oh right great! Welcome aboard!
4372,Okay!,"All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don't need any assistance in there, take a break!"
4373,Joey!,"I know, here-here!!"
4374,Hi!,Hi!
4375,"Hi! I love you on that show! I watch you everyday! I mean, when you took out your own kidney to save your ex-wife even though she tired to kill you...","Well, it's always nice to meet the fans."
4376,Ah!,She's not crazy is she?
4377,No.,"So uh, how you doin'?"
4378,"Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! Go!! Who's this? Oh okay, you're gonna like working for me. What's your name? What kind of name is Brendy? I... Whatever... Stop talking! All right, from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name.",Hey there you are!
4379,"Uh-oh, it's my boss!","All right, here's a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work I'm delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine!"
4380,"""Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, """"Bring me food."""" Two is, """"I'm with a girl, bring us food."""" Three is, """"I'm lost and I can't find food.""""""","Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?"
4381,Yeah! She's right in there!,"Oh great. Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready!"
4382,,"All right, and over there is Brady's Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning."
4383,Wow! This is so amazing! What else? What else?,"Well, that is a large piece of television equipment. And uh that is an old man! Hey old man!"
4384,Hey!,"All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?"
4385,"Wow! Umm, y'know, I-I would really love to, but I-I shouldn't.","Why? Why can't the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us?"
4386,Isn't that a line from the show?!,"Uh, yeah but uh, I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now."
4387,That's a line from the show too!,"Okay, you watch too much TV."
4388,"Here you go Joe, here's the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for.","Thanks! Yeah, there's pulp in that."
4389,Yeah?,"I thought we talked about this. I don't like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn't juice. All juice, okay?"
4390,"I'm sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.","Oh my God, I'm sorry, I'm being so rude. Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it."
4391,"Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.",Iced tea.
4392,"Okay, anything for you sir?",Did I not just tell him?
4393,"Yes, you did.","Okay look, Chandler, if this you have got to listen! You're gonna throw that juice at me, aren't ya?"
4394,Okay!!,"Hey! Hey Chandler look, I know you're mad, but I just want to say I'm sorry. I-I was a total jerk. Completely o-over the line. Uh, I just I hate pulp! Y'know? I mean, y'know how Monica feels about low fat mayonnaise?"
4395,It's not mayonnaise!!,"Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say I'm sorry. Here."
4396,What's this?,"Fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! Just the way you like it."
4397,"Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!",Oh my God! That's great! Congratulations! What's the story?!
4398,"Oh you wouldn't uh, care. It's just a stupid comic book story.",Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
4399,"Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist-as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can't have lumps in them.",Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? 'Cause I think I read it!
4400,"Ohh, I mean it's just so realistic!","I know. Yeah, his name is Pat."
4401,Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!,"Do you uh, do you-ready for a refill?"
4402,"Oh, I probably shouldn't-so I will! Oh! Wow! It's like it's raining!","Pretty cool, huh? But if you're thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn't get sucked up into the mechanism, well you'd be wrong."
4403,"Umm, can I use your bathroom?","It's uh, right through there."
4404,"Okay. God y'know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani's apartment...","Yeah, life's pretty great isn't it?"
4405,"Joey, you're such an amazing actor! How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?","Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own."
4406,Wow! Tell me something Joey--Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.,Yeah you did.
4407,Okay.,Here you go. Let me ask you a question.
4408,Yeah?,When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
4409,"Wow! I can't, I can't feel my hands.","Come, come here."
4410,,Morning!
4411,Oh right.,Yeah.
4412,Oh God. Oh I can't believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!,Well he actually saw you a little bit too.
4413,"Noo! Oh God we did-we didn't, we didn't uhh...","No! No! No, not after seeing that."
4414,God I'm just a horrible person.,Wh-why?
4415,"Because I'm married. That's right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star's apartment to have an affair! Uck!","""That's ridiculous! I'm not a """"Star,"""" just a regular famous actor."""
4416,"Yeah and I'm a horrible, horrible person.","Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me..."
4417,"The ring from the cave, yeah.","Wow! Uh okay, well uh..."
4418,"Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!",Sure! As long as they don't find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.
4419,No! No-no-no...,"Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you've had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn't. And that's what this ring stands for."
4420,But I thought that ring stood for Caprice's undying love for her brother.,"Look, do you want the ring or not?!"
4421,Hey!,Hey!
4422,Look at you! You're up!,All right!
4423,I thought I'd try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water? I'll be back soon.,"Whoa-whoa-whoa! You're not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are ya?"
4424,Hey Joe did... Did you ever have a threesome?,"Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think Carol's great and I'm sure you're a very attractive man, but I...."
4425,No! The reason I'm asking is that... I sorta had one last night.,You?
4426,Yeah!,Wow!
4427,Yeah!,"All right! So, was it amazing?"
4428,"It was, it was okay.",Just okay-Did you do it right?!
4429,"""Look, it's just did, did you ever go to a party and think, """"Would really anyone miss me if I weren't here?""""""","Huh. But still Ross, you're worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! Y'know what I mean?"
4430,"It's just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and then there was a lot of waiting around.","But you got to be with both of them, right?"
4431,Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.,Not the other one?
4432,"No, she kept kicking me away!","Yeah, you don't want that."
4433,No!,"Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right?"
4434,Oh I a lot of stuff!,You got a little bored?
4435,A little. Yeah. I made a snack.,Yeah? What did ya have?
4436,"Just a sandwich. Turkey, a little mustard...",Sounds good.
4437,"Yeah, what, what was I thinking?","Hey! So, what's with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?"
4438,Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.,Y'know what's more generous than that?! Fifty percent! Y'know what's even more generous than that?!!
4439,What's up with the greed Joe?,"All right, look I'm sorry you guys, but it's just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they're really expensive, y'know? I'm down to like three! Well, actually two 'cause one of 'em I kinda blackened in some teeth-Why did I do that?!"
4440,"Oh, wait! Wait! Don't you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you'll get that job!","Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!"
4441,"Ah, finally an explanation.","No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember? Let's see uh, well I don't want to donate sperm again. I really prefer doing that at the home office y'know? Ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?"
4442,Joey!,Yeah?
4443,What did I tell you about talking to your friends while you're working?,Uhh do it?
4444,That guy has been waiting for his coffee for ten minutes! He's complained about you three times!,"Well, where was I?"
4445,"Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!",Takes it out of you?
4446,She was working on Valentine's Day so we're celebrating it tonight.,"Ohh, hey! Why don't you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?"
4447,"Ooh, Joey, that's actually a really good idea!","And of course, crotchless panties."
4448,You guys!,"You can't make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut..."
4449,,"Hi uh, I'm Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect I'd like to donate some fluids."
4450,"We're actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so we're not looking for applicants right now.","Oh that's too bad. I've kinda been saving up. Uh, are you sure there's no studies I can participate in?"
4451,"Well, here's a schedule of what's coming up.",Thanks. Well but this one starts now.
4452,"Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. It's a twins study.","But it's $2,000."
4453,Sorry.,Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.
4454,,"2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin. Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me?"
4455,I'm Joey! How are you doin'?!,No! No! No! No! No! How you doin'?! How you doin'-Damnit Carl! Go wait in the hall!
4456,No! No! No! No! No! How you doin'?! How you doin'-Damnit Carl! Go wait in the hall!,"Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl."
4457,Who the hell is Carl?!,"Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project."
4458,"Y'know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?","Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y'know? The only problem is, Carl's acting is..."
4459,The only problem!,"Yeah, he's the reason I didn't get that big Minute Maid commercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up."
4460,"Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake?",Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!!
4461,,"All right Carl, we're next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?"
4462,Another Minute Maid fiasco.,That's right! And what are you not gonna do?
4463,"Well, I'm not gonna talk because...",Damnit Carl!
4464,Can I have the next one please? Joey and Tony Tribbiani.,That's us.
4465,"But uh, this is a study for identical twins.","That's right, $2,000."
4466,"But, you're not identical twins.",Damnit Carl!
4467,"Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.","Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?"
4468,Yeah.,"Oh, 'cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there's your admirer."
4469,"Besides, there's a big age difference.","Oh, well think of it like this, when you're 90..."
4470,I know when I'm 90 she'll be like 80 and it won't seem like such a big difference.,"No that's not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you're 90 you'll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old."
4471,,Hey Chandler! Y'know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
4472,It's Chandler's way of pretending he didn't take mime.,"Oh well listen, anyway she's directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!"
4473,"Oh, I don't know man. I haven't talked to her in like ten years.","No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!"
4474,"You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred...","Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?"
4475,"Oh okay, I'll-I'll try.","All right! Thanks! You're the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?"
4476,"Yeah so, Tuesday?","Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this, the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!"
4477,Thank you.,Okay.
4478,What are you smiling about? What is so funny?,"The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!"
4479,My God!,"Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?"
4480,,"Oh, how bad is it?"
4481,"God, it's great to catch up! I can't believe how long it's been!","Chandler, is that..."
4482,Oh that's great! Good for you.,Hey-hey listen...
4483,"Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm... Can you hold for one second please? What?!","When you're off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?"
4484,"Hi! I'm back. Yeah, that sounds great. Okay. Well, we'll do it then. Okay, bye-bye.","Hey listen, so when's-when's my audition? I mean I know it's Thursday, but what time?"
4485,We didn't get to the audition. I'm gonna take her to coffee and then we'll do it then.,Ah-ha!
4486,"All right, well why don't I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!","Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey."
4487,,This right here is where I keep the pizza. And uh that's where the napkin is.
4488,What's that smell?,I know!
4489,,This is where I keep the pizza. And-Hey! Where did the napkin go?!
4490,,"Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't the hair straightener that started the fire. No-no, it was the candles. It's very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is... Uhh... Uhh... Okay. Well, I have to go now."
4491,Yeah. What-what should I do?,"Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what's more important? What people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart."
4492,Hey.,"Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?"
4493,I couldn't do it.,You couldn't do it?!
4494,Joey! You didn't even know her!,Ah whatever!
4495,"Oh, Joey! Sorry!",No that's all right. Don't worry about it.
4496,Oh but look! That's gonna leave a stain!,Rach! Hey! It's fine! You're at Joey's!

4508,"Hi Joey, how ya doin'?",Great! Roomie!
4509,"Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.","Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot."
4510,I'm not paying for half of that! I'm only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.,"Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya'?"
4511,That refrigerators don't live as long as people.,"All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time, I'll take a check for the other hundred."
4512,You're jokin' right?,Of course I'm jokin'! I don't take checks.
4513,"Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here.","Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you Chandler."
4514,So he has to be a male who has at least $50.,Ooh! So close.
4515,"Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y'know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.","Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how's it going with her?"
4516,Hey.,Huh.
4517,"Well, you...don't look good Joe.","The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes-Hey, what was in that brown jar?"
4518,That's still in there?!,"Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?"
4519,Is this a service you're providing me?,No! No! No! For my new fridge-our new fridge!
4520,Our new fridge? I don't live here anymore.,"So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple."
4521,Uh-huh.,"And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid."
4522,Okay...,Give me $400!
4523,Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.,"Or! You can just, y'know..."
4524,What the hell are you doing?,What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!
4525,"What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!","Oh-ho-ho, you think I don't know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me! Well what do you know! Broken! That'll be $400!"
4526,"Joey, I saw you push him!",You pushed him!
4527,"Joey, I did not break this! Okay? That has been broken for a while.","All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?"
4528,Uh-huh.,I still haven't gotten a check for your half yet.
4529,Do not give him any money!,I'm not talking to you! You broke my fridge!
4530,"Okay now it doesn't matter which one you choose, y'know? It's completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.","Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!"
4531,Okay sure!,Really?!
4532,"Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions.",Call it even?
4533,"Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl's bodies, waking up next to people you don't even know...","Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?"
4534,You know the hotels?,Sure! I was there! Spring Break '81! Woo-hoo!
4535,In 1981 you were 13!,"So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y'know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks."
4536,I wanna say a disease.,Hey!
4537,Hey!,I just got this really weird message from Ross. He said turn on MTV.
4538,Oh-oh Professor Geller.,"Ahh, to be 13 again."
4539,,"The reactor's gonna blow in three seconds, we're never gonna make it!"
4540,You've got to get out of here! Save yourself!,No! I won't leave you!
4541,"Don't worry about me, I'm a robot! I'm just a machine!!",No you're not! Not to me!
4542,Oh my God.,What?
4543,I am extremely talented!,"Yeah, you're great! Okay, let's take it from..."
4544,"No, I mean I was really acting my ass off.","Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too."
4545,"Oh yeah, you're solid. Yeah, you're just no me.",Y'know what? I think that's enough for now. Yeah. I don't want to be over rehearsed.
4546,"So uh, what's this thing you're auditioning for?","""Oh, it's a new TV show. Yeah. I'm up for the part of Mac Macaveli or """"Mac."""" Yeah, I'm a detective and I solve crimes with the help of my robot partner. He's a, he's a Computerized Humanoid Electronically Enhanced Secret Enforcer or-or """"C.H.E.E.S.E."""""""
4547,So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.,That's the title! Yeah! Y'know they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.
4548,"Huh-Wait so Joey if you get this, you're gonna be like the star of your own TV show! I mean you'll be like the Big Cheese! Or the Big Mac-Hey! You love those!","Well, don't get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen."
4549,"Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?",I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just don't know if I'm good enough.
4550,"Joey, what are you talking about? You're a terrific actor.",You really think so?
4551,"Whoa, she's pretty.","Yeah, and oh she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting."
4552,Excuse me?,"It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this."
4553,"Oh, ok.","""There's my scene, there's my scene. """"Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..."""""""

4560,"Oh, are we playing this?!",Hey.
4561,Hey! How'd the audition go?,Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn't even be an actor!
4562,"Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn't go well but it really did go well?","Yeah, did I fool ya?"
4563,So it did go well.,"Oh, it went amazingly well!"
4564,Oh that's great!,"Yeah-yeah, it's down to me and two other guys."
4565,Wow!,"And I know both of them, they're really good. One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who's always getting chased by those big flowers..."
4566,What am I doing?,I'm just so nervous! Y'know? The callback isn't until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!
4567,"Look, don't worry. Okay? You're gonna be fine.","There's just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I don't know if you'd understand."
4568,,"I want this part so much! Y'know? If I don't get this part I'm never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again!-No, I didn't say that! That's a lie."
4569,,Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?
4570,,"Hello? What are you talking about? The audition's not 'til 5:00! Well, nobody told me! Who'd you talk to? Nevermind!"
4571,You mean you didn't get it from this?,The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
4572,"Well, maybe we can fix it y'know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!",How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could've turned my whole career around!
4573,"I messed up. Okay? I'm sorry, I really messed up.","Hey, you don't even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!"
4574,"Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and...",And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
4575,No! No! No! I just kissed her.,What?!! That's even worse!!
4576,How is that worse?!,I don't know! But it's the same!
4577,"You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.","Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line, that you-you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you!"
4578,"Look, I'm not saying that you should magically forgive me! But you're not perfect! You've made some errors in judgment too!",Name one!
4579,What happened?!!,"Awww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!!"
4580,What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!,"Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!"
4581,So--You got in voluntarily?!,"I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?"
4582,What?,No way! I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
4583,Cupping.,"That's how they do pants! Ross, will you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?"
4584,,I said name one!
4585,,"Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own."
4586,Oh my God!,Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
4587,,"Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges."
4588,,Hey!
4589,Please tell me you got the message!,What message?
4590,"The actor playing Mac couldn't do it, they needed to see you at 2 o'clock.",What?! It's 6 o'clock!
4591,"Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross's! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!",I can't believe this Chandler!
4592,Sorry! I-I-I don't know what to say.,Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!!
4593,Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!,"Oh, well I'm uh..."
4594,"Y'know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!","Oh wow! Okay man, I'm sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad."
4595,Well that's good. Because you didn't! And I'm incredibly happy for ya!!,That's mean! You really had me going there!

4599,"I think so. Yeah, get off me.",Yeah.
4600,,"Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., I'm not leaving without you! Try routing your backup source through your primary CPU."
4601,I can't! My circuits are fried! They're fried I tell you!!,Wow! Well then I'll just have to carry you.
4602,"That'll be a neat trick, when you're, when you're dead!","Ross, you don't have to yell."
4603,Oh my God. I mean...,Y'know what? I think that's enough for today. Thanks for your help!
4604,,Hey guys!
4605,Oh that's right. It's your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?,Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? I've dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!
4606,"No! Joey, you're going to be great!","But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I don't know anything about technology! I can't even use Chandler's computer except to find porn! And-and that's only 'cause it's right there when you turn it on!"
4607,"So uh, here's your office set!","Wow! Huh? Mac Macaveli, Private Investigator!"
4608,Let's get you into wardrobe for a fitting.,"Okay. Hey uh, when do I get to meet the robot?"
4609,"I'm sorry, why don't we do that right now? He's right here.",Okay.
4610,"Joey Tribbiani, this is...",Oh wow! He's so lifelike! Unbelievable! (He starts tugging on the guy's ears.
4611,"This is Wayne, the man who created and operates C.H.E.E.S.E.","How do you do there, Wayne?"
4612,"I'll let you two guys get acquainted, huh?","Okay. Sorry about that... Uh, so where's C.H.E.E.S.E.?"
4613,Nice to meet you Mac!,"This is like the temporary robot, right?"
4614,No. Why?,"Well, I-I just, I just it was going to be like a really cool robot, y'know? Like the terminator or uh, when I first saw you."
4615,"I spent two years developing this machine, it's absolutely state of the art.","I'm sorry, it just-I don't know it doesn't really look like it can do anything."
4616,,Hey!
4617,How was your first day?,Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
4618,"Damn those robots, they're supposed to be our faithful servants!","Anyway, it wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh!"
4619,"Well, why don't you just get him fired?","I may have to, I hate to do it, but I'm the star! Y'know? There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor. Excuse me. Joey Tribbiani."
4620,"Joe! I'm glad I found ya, I got an audition for ya!",Wow!
4621,"The thing is it's kinda on the Q.T. The actor who has the part doesn't know he might be fired. It's the lead in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.",I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!
4622,,"Apparently, there's like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there's only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn't know he could get me fired! What am I going to do?"
4623,"Well y'know Joey, you're a pretty charming guy.","Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here."
4624,"No sweetie, you've got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You've got to kiss some serious robot ass!","That's not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I'm not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys. Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs."
4625,,"Morning! Hey, how's my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!"
4626,Don't touch him!,"Okay! All right. Umm, all right Wayne, level with me. Okay? I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired. Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part! Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance! I mean, I love-I love this little guy! Ah-ah!! Okay, that's why you didn't want me to touch him right? Here you go! Okay? Stupid! I can't believe it! God! Hey, how you doin'?"
4627,,I can't believe I'm going to lose this job!
4628,Oh I'm so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?,Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
4629,"Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.","Yeah? Well, I don't want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler."
4630,"Joey, Joey, I-I-I'll g-get you your job back if you help me out.",Why should I help you?!
4631,The reason he just said.,What do you need?
4632,"I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, y'know Sarah?",Yeah?
4633,I wish I could talk to her.,What are you in love with her or something?
4634,"Listen, I-I guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do.","Oh wow Wayne, it's not really something you can teach y'know? It's pretty much something you're born with if you--You-you can teach it! I'll show you right how to do it."
4635,,"Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E."
4636,The shipment never made it through Omaha?,"You got it! And the rabbi's beard, 100% horsehair. Nice catch C.H.E.E.S.E.! It's your line C.H.E.E.S.E.! Wayne! Wayne!!"
4637,Well it's just-it's one of those situations that I just hate. Y'know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.,Now you're thinking you gotta sleep with him.
4638,I'll give up my ticket.,Me too.
4639,It's mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.,Oh man!
4640,Hey!,Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!
4641,"Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek!","I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin' up about something... Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he's just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi bastard, I'll..."
4642,,Hey! So I'm back.
4643,Who are you?,"Joey Tribbiani! From the wall! Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh? Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I'm ready to go back up on the wall I'm the star of a new TV show."
4644,Show me in the table.,"Oh well, it's not on TV yet."
4645,"Well, then it's not on the wall yet.","Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh?"
4646,,"Hey! So, did you watch the tape of my show?"
4647,I did.,"All right, let's get me back up there!"

4649,"Yes, it was very offensive to my people!",Dry cleaners?
4650,Russians! It showed them as terrorists and villains!,"Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!"
4651,"That's right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer, he brings us a lot of clothes; you bring us nothing!","Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-that's offensive to Russians."
4652,I've never seen it!,"Oh you should, it's great."
4653,Can I help you?,"Uh yeah, where-where's the guy who decides who's pictures go up on the wall?"
4654,He's not here right now.,"Oh, you're kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I'm an actor; I'm kinda getting my picture up there on the wall."
4655,"Y'know, there are two people who could put your picture up there.","Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks? You're the other one right?"
4656,"""Oh! Here it is! Ooh, Joey! Why did you sign it, """"Son of a bitch?""""""",I didn't do that! Who would've done that?!
4657,Joey!,"Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I-Hey! I did not go out with your wife! Okay? I went out with her!"
4658,"Well, we should go.",Yeah.
4659,,Hey Gunther.

4661,Do you still work here?,"No! No, I quit a long time ago. Did I forget to you that one? I'm sorry."
4662,"Oh that's cool, I was gonna fire you anyway.",Great!

4665,"Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?",No.
4666,Remember? You-you were eating pizza.,Yeah.
4667,"Okay. Well, apparently Chandler's angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.","Oh, we're supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!"
4668,"Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y'know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.",Oh wow that's a great idea! And I still have his credit card.
4669,Oh.,"Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go. Y'know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just-I don't get Chandler. Y'know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don't get all upset."

4676,"Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?",No! He blew us off!
4677,What?!,I know!
4678,I can't believe it. Can I tell you something? I'm a little mad at him now.,Can I tell you something? Me too.
4679,"Y'know what? He didn't want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don't talk to him at all!",Ooooh! Freeze him out.
4680,That's right!,I like it!
4681,Eh? We'll show him!,"From now on, it's gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends. Okay! We're gonna be the new Joey and Chandler."
4682,Guys? I've got something important to tell ya. Guys? Guys?! I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.,I think we gotta end the freeze out.
4683,"Yeah, check out the ring.",Oh my God!!

4694,I can do that for the kids.,"Hey, y'know what? I'll come too. I'm making money now; it's about time I give something back."
4695,"Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.",Okay. Have a benefit.
4696,"Uh-uh-Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it doesn't really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I'm the one dating Elizabeth, not you!",That's not what she said last night.
4697,"Will you marry me? Will you marry me? Hey, you marry me! What's going on little elves?",It's the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
4698,And I also brought my friend Joey...,Oh!! Shrimp toast!
4699,Hey you guys! Look!,Hey!
4700,"And finally, our biggest item of the night, the 22-foot gentleman's day sailer sailboat. The winning bid was a whooping $20,000!",I won! That was my guess!
4701,What?! What?! What?!,"I guessed 20,000!"
4702,"Joey! It is an auction! You don't guess, you buy!","What?! I don't have 20,000!"
4703,What were you thinking?!,I didn't know it was an auction!
4704,Wh?!,"I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!"
4705,Why would a charity give away a free boat?!,I don't know! Charity?
4706,Mr. Tribbiani.,Oh hi!
4707,Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building the youth center.,"Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?"
4708,"I think it was valued at 19,000","Hey, I was pretty close. Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can't buy the boat, I don't have any money."
4709,,"So uh listen, I think I'm gonna take off now."
4710,"Hey! You...can't...leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!","Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don't have that kind of money!"
4711,"I know. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what we're gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you're just gonna pay the difference.",Okay.
4712,Okay.,"Look, I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Y'know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!"
4713,,"Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one."
4714,Oh great!,Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.
4715,,"Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?"
4716,That's me.,"Ahh, yes."
4717,"Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000.",You-you have to pay that! It's not just a guess.

4723,"But Joey you don't have $20,000!","Who cares?! I-I'll make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr. Bowmont!!"
4724,,"Oh my God, you're back!"

4726,Richard was there so I couldn't do it!,What?! Noooo...
4727,"I'm gonna do it tomorrow y'know, and-and surprise her, but now you've ruined it!",We didn't ruin it!
4728,"Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor...",Glove salesman!
4729,"I can do that, I've had 30 years of practice.","Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off!"
4730,I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!,That guy's still doing that?!
4731,"Okay, okay, here she comes! How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?","Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. I never noticed that before."
4732,Hi guys!,Hey!
4733,"Oh, just hanging out, talkin' about uh, websites. Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.","Yeah, Big Brother."
4734,,The Mr. Bowmont's here!!!
4735,,"Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?"
4736,,Hey Monica!
4737,Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?,"This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?"
4738,"Yeah, it's great.","Whoa-whoa, what's the matter?! Talk to the captain!"
4739,I'm just having one of those days where you realize you're in a dead-end relationship!,Chandler giving you a hard time huh?
4740,"It's not like I want to get married tomorrow! It's just that I-I'd like to believe that I'm in a relationship that's actually going somewhere, that I'm not just wasting my time!","Well, you know Chandler."
4741,No I don't know Chandler! Not anymore! It's like it's like something's changed.,Maybe you changed?
4742,I didn't change!,Maybe that's the problem.
4743,What?!,"Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife."
4744,Is that some kind of boat talk?,I don't know! I haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
4745,What does he think? Does he think I'm just gonna wait around for nothing?,"Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!"
4746,Well there's some people who do want to marry me.,There are?
4747,Yeah! Richard!,R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! And-and Chandler's tellin' ya how much he hates marriage?!
4748,That's right.,Chandler loves marriage!!
4749,You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he's a-a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife! That-that he's against marriage and always will be!,You got that from what I said?!
4750,,Where the hell have you been?!
4751,I was making a coconut phone with the professor.,Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!
4752,What?!,"Yeah! Yeah, I've been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!"
4753,My-Oh my God!,I know! They suck!!
4754,He's not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I'm supposed to do that!,I know!
4755,Well what... Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go over there; I'm gonna kick his ass! Will you help me?!,"Look, Chandler I don't think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!"
4756,You're right.,Yeah!
4757,Okay. I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna go find her and I'm just going to propose!,Okay.
4758,Okay great.,Dude-dude-dude!
4759,What?!,"Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat."
4760,What?!,Hey!
4761,Hey!,Phoebe! We're both your backup?!
4762,,No we weren't!
4763,Phoebe you can't have both of them! You have to pick one!,Pick me!!
4764,"All right well let's see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat-This is hard!","This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!"
4765,"Okay, y'know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right here, this is what we're gonna do! I'm gonna write Joey on one napkin and I'm gonna right Ross on the other napkin and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?",Okay that's fair.
4766,Yeah absolutely!,Yeah.
4767,,Dude!
4768,"I can't talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!",She's gone.
4769,What?,She's gone. She had a bag and she left.
4770,What are you talking about?,"She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think."
4771,Well why didn't you stop her?! Why didn't you just tell her it was a plan?!,"I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn't believe me."
4772,Well where... Where did she go?,To her parent's I think and she said you shouldn't call her. But if I were you I would.
4773,I can't believe I ruined this.,I am so sorry man.
4774,,Can we come it yet?! We're dying out here!
4775,"Oh hell, he's done this three times! He knows what its about!",Yeah!
4776,"""I found a note on my door, """"Come to Monica's quick, bring champagne and a Three Musketeers bar.""""""",Yeah I'll take that.
4777,,"Yeah, she's been out there for twenty minutes, I'm surprised you didn't hear her on the way over."
4778,,"But I-I-I can't stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I'm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. What?"
4779,"""So when you said, """"Get up early,"""" did you mean 1986?""",You guys don't think I look 19?
4780,,"Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?"
4781,"Oh honey no, you ate it all.",I was afraid of that.
4782,,'Sup? 'Sup dude?
4783,"Take whatever you want, just please don't hurt me.","So you're playing a little Playstation, huh? That's whack! Playstation is whack! 'Sup with the whack Playstation, 'sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!"
4784,"Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.","Come on man, really how old?!"
4785,"Young! You're a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody's ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!",Wow thanks!
4786,Joe?,Yeah!
4787,"Uhh, you've had a lot of sex right?","When? Today? Some, not a lot."
4788,"Well, it's just the reason that I'm asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to-I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn't.... There huh-hmm, there-there was an incident.","Don't worry about that man, that happens."
4789,It's happened to you?,Yeah! Once.
4790,"Well, what'd you do?",I did it anyway.
4791,,Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!
4792,"What a great night, Chandler can't do it, these guys kissed...",What?
4793,What?!,You guys kissed! Oh my-this is huge!
4794,"Well yeah, that and Chandler's problem.","Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel."
4795,Yes that would be lovely.,"You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!"
4796,"Yes, you can pass for 19.",Really?
4797,Yes!,Seriously?
4798,"Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!",I'm 30!
4799,"Joey, you are not! You're 31.",Aww crap!
4800,"No-no, I-I really don't want to talk about it! I don't! Especially with you.","Psss, that is whack!"
4801,"Yeah? Okay, I think I'll play it at the wedding.","""Yeah! Well, I think we'll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, """"You look 19,"""" and then they just take it away like-like, """"No you don't."""""""
4802,"Well, I don't think Monica is gonna take this away.",Wouldn't she?
4803,Would she?,Would she? You ate my candy bar!
4804,,"They break your heart, don't they?"
4805,"Y'know, I don't really their permission.","Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!"
4806,"Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you... You gotta do something about your eyes.",What?! What's wrong with my eyes.
4807,They give you away! There's just-there's just too much wisdom in there. Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.,And that'll get rid of my wisdom?
4808,,Hey!
4809,Hi!,Who wants French toast?
4810,"Oh, I'll have some!","Good, me too. Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks."
4811,"Well, you couldn't get them anyway. Ian doesn't plan anymore and Derrick... And Derrick is a name I shouldn't know.","Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? Y'know, something a little snugglyer?"
4812,Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?,"Well, the duck..."
4813,What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!,"Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!"
4814,Uh-huh!,"Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I'm gonna get cranky!"
4815,"Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!","Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!"
4816,What?!,"All right, I'm gonna go!"
4817,"Now Joey, what did the duck do?!",I don't know! But he did not eat your face cream!
4818,,"Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? What the hell is in that face cream? That's so soft. Pillowcases! Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar... The vicar? ...wouldn't be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his... Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book!"
4819,"Hey Joey, what 'cha doing?",Sweepin'. Why? Turn you on?
4820,No.,Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
4821,,Where are you going? The vicar won't be home for hours.
4822,"Joey, where did you learn that word?","Where do you think, Zelda?"
4823,You found my book?!,Yeah I did!
4824,"Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!","Okay, look I'm sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn!"
4825,"Hey-hey, y'know what? I don't care! I'm not ashamed of my book. There's nothing with a woman enjoying a little...erotica. It's just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.",You got porn!
4826,,Hey Rach.
4827,Joey.,"Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?"
4828,"Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.","No-no-no, I'm serious. You don't smell it? Something's on fire."
4829,"Well no, I don't smell anything.","Oh, y'know what? It's probably just your burnin' loins."
4830,"He said he liked that!! Oh you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.","Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?"
4831,His daughter was hot.,Gotcha.
4832,,"Hello, Zelda."
4833,Who are you supposed to be?,The vicar!
4834,Do you even know what a vicar is?,"Like a goalie, right?"
4835,"Yeah. Look Joey, it's enough all right?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it's-I'm not-it's just not funny anymore!","All right, I'm sorry. Rach I-Rach I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn."
4836,All right! Y'know what? That's it! You wanna do it?! Let's do it!,Huh?
4837,"That's right, I wanna do it with you! I've been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.",I-I-I-I did?
4838,"Yeah! Ohh, I've been waitin' so long to get on that body!",This body?
4839,Yeah that's right! Come on Joey; sex me up!,"Hey-hey, you're startin' to sound like the butcher's wife there in-in chapter seven."
4840,"Oh, come on now, don't keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because you're in for a rough ride!","I don't want to, I'm scared."
4841,"Yeah, what?",What?
4842,"Are you kidding? Okay, I'll give you a hint; I'll give you a hint.","Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler's eyes!"
4843,"Yeah-yeah, did-didn't you use to have a pair? They were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm...",Feminine.
4844,Our kids are gonna be fat aren't they.,Ahoy!
4845,Hey! How's the boat?!,Great! I'm finally getting into this sailing stuff.
4846,"Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?",Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
4847,"If you don't sail your boat, what do you do on it?","Oh, it's great! It's a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips."
4848,"Y'know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.",You could?
4849,,Look at this clown! Just because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. Get out of the way jackass! Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?
4850,That is the Coast Guard.,What are they doing out here? The coast's all the way over there.
4851,"Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We're not finished with the lesson yet.",All right.
4852,"Okay, I'm just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?","Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let's start sailing, and I want to go over there where that boatload of girls is! Yo-ho-ho!"
4853,"Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let's do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, what's this called?","Uh, boat rope."
4854,Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?,"Uhh, rub it?"
4855,No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?,"I'd say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh..."
4856,"Time's up, now your dead.",And deaf!
4857,"Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?!",Yes.
4858,"Don't just say yes! This isn't a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!",I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.
4859,That and arrogance.,Hey.
4860,Hey! How was sailing?,"I don't want to talk about it. Y'know, you could've at least saved me a whole cookie."
4861,No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!,Women are mean!!!
4862,Thank you!,Hey.
4863,"Well hello! So, when are we gettin' back out on the water matey?","Oh uh, I don't know the boat way to say this, but uh never!"
4864,Why not?,Because! You're mean on the boat!
4865,What? I was just trying to teach you.,"Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!"
4866,"Look Joey, I'm sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.","""Does a good teacher say, """"Put down the beer pinhead!?"""""""
4867,"Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?",Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?
4868,"Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the boom!",Well it hit me anyway! And it would've hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.
4869,"All right, y'know what? I-I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.",You won't boss me around anymore?
4870,I won't boss you around.,And you'll be nice?
4871,"And, I'll be nice.",And you'll be topless?
4872,And-Joey!,Do you want me to learn?!
4873,"Okay Joey honey, you're doing really good! All right, now I'm just gonna need you to step to the port side. Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?",Ohh yeah.
4874,Right?,Nope.
4875,"It's left sweetie, but that's okay sweetie, that's a tough one.",I don't know why you just don't say left.
4876,"Okay, go to the left. The left!",Huh?
4877,Just sit over there!!,"Okay! Okay, you're yelling again! See that?"
4878,"No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.","Oh, y'know what? Since I'm here, I think I'm gonna have me a little beer on the port side."
4879,"Okay Joey, we're luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham?","Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn't know there."
4880,"Joey, come on! We just went over this!","Oh, y'know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!"
4881,"No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!",All right that's it! You're yelling and I don't see you taking your top off! I quit!
4882,What do you mean you quit?! You can't quit!,Why not?!
4883,Because you're not finished yet and I won't have it! Greens do not quit!,Greens? I'm a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!
4884,"Oh my God, wait did I-I just said Greens don't quit didn't I? Did I just say Greens don't quit?!",Yes! Yes! You did and you're still yelling at me!
4885,"No! No! No! I'm not yelling at you, I'm just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh I'm my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I've been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin'. Oh, Joey, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.","Well, hey I did learn."
4886,Really?,Yeah! Come on.
4887,Awww...,"Yeah, it's okay. I know what a mainsail is. I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right."
4888,Left.,Damnit!
4889,"Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.","Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don't you give a pull on that rope?"
4890,Ohh we're not sailing.,Just pull on it.
4891,All right. Hey-hey-hey!! Sandwiches!,What else?
4892,Here you go.,Thank you.
4893,Oh wow!,What are you doing?
4894,"Ohh, sorry.",What you-don't hold it like that! You're lettin' all the good stuff fall out.
4895,Ohh whoops.,Careful! You're wasting good pastrami! Oh my God! I'm my dad!
4896,,"So, what did you guys think?"
4897,That's nice.,"Mom, so what did you think?"
4898,"Uh-huh, yeah that's right.","Wow! Well, my folks really liked it! So what-what did you guys think? It wasn't that good."
4899,"Oh! Hi you guys, oh my God! You'll never gonna believe happened to me today! I am sitting in my office and...",You guys! You guys! You're not gonna believe what my agent just told me!
4900,Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here!,"Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go."
4901,"Okay, so anyway I'm sittin' in my office and guess who walks in.",I'm gonna be on two TV shows!
4902,Joey!,"Oh, you weren't finished?"
4903,Yeah! Guess who walks into my office is the end of my story. It was Ralph Lauren! Ralph Lauren walked into my office!,"Uh Rach, if you're gonna start another story, at least let me finish mine."
4904,It's the same story.,"Wow, it's really long."
4905,I'm so happy for you!,"Well, these really are the days of our lives."
4906,What?!,"Well, since you ask. They want me back on Days of Our Lives!"
4907,Oh hey!,"I'll be playing Drake Remoray's twin brother, Stryker!"
4908,Ahhh!!,Well-I got a head rush from standing up to fast right there.
4909,Hey-hey-hey Joey!,Hey Terry!
4910,Good to see you again!,"It's been a while, huh? Wow, it's funny these halls look smaller then they used to."
4911,It's a different building.,So! Stryker Remoray huh? When do you want me to start?
4912,Why don't we start right now!,Okay.
4913,Here are the audition scenes.,Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part.
4914,Why would you think that?,"Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker's twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?"
4915,Everybody has to audition.,"Y'know Terry, I-I don't really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series, with a robot."
4916,I'm sorry Joey that's...that's the way it is.,"Well. I guess you think you're pretty special huh? Sittin' up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin' stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well y'know what? This is one star who's hoop... This is a star that the hoop-this hoop-I was Dr. Drake Remoray!"
4917,Hi!,Hey.
4918,"Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes.",Was she happy you gave her the job?
4919,,"Hello? Oh hey! Can you, can you hang on a second? It's the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. can you excuse me for a minute? Hey, funny you should call. I was just looking over next week's script. Canceled?! Like they're taking it off the air? Ohh. All right, see you Monday. We're not even shootin' them anymore?!! All right, bye! They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!"
4920,I'm sorry Joey.,Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
4921,,"How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin'!"
4922,"Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?","Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there."
4923,What happened?,Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.
4924,"Joey, why would you do that?",Because they wanted me to audition!
4925,,Hey! Terry.
4926,Joey Tribbiani! I'm surprised your big head could fit through our small halls! I gotta go Joey.,"Wait! Terry! Wait-Look-Wait I-I... Look, I'm really sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking I'm too big to audition for you. You gotta give me another chance."
4927,I can't help you Joey.,"Wait! Terry! Please! Look, I just lost my other job. Okay? You have no idea how much I need this. Please, help me out, for old times sake."
4928,And cut!,I'm back baby! Ha-ha-ha!
4929,Hi Joey! What are you doing here?,"Uhh, well I've got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt. You got an extra one?"
4930,"Yeah, sure. Umm...here.",Great. You got anything that's not Ralph Lauren?
4931,"Yeah, I don't think so Joe.","All right, I guess this will be fine."
4932,"Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?","Nothing, why?"
4933,How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I'll pay.,"Huh, Rach I got to say it's gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude."
4934,I'm not asking you to go on a date with him!,Really? 'Cause I could kinda use the money.
4935,"Joey, just-just he-he's new in town and I know he doesn't have any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. I'll really appreciate it.","Yeah, okay."
4936,Yeah?,"Sure, no problem. Ooh-Hey, donuts!"
4937,Yeah!,Okay.
4938,,"See? That's a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a camera. You're changing it!"
4939,I can't help it!,"All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?"
4940,Borrow money from me?,"Okay, first-first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down , look down, keep looking down; then I look up. See? All right, now you try. Look down , you're looking down, keep looking down..."
4941,Why is there jelly on your shoe?,I had a donut.
4942,Hi!,Hey!
4943,"So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night.",Yeah! That guy's all right!
4944,Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.,What?
4945,"Y'know, all the women.","Hey well, you can't teach someone to be good with women. Y'know, that's why I never had any luck with Chandler."
4946,"All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, it's just-And I know he's my assistant and I can't date him-but it just bothers me, all right?!","Hey! No-no-no-no, you can't take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!"
4947,"All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!",What?!
4948,"I just don't want him to meet anybody until I am over my crush-And I will get over it. It's-it's not like I love him, it's just physical! But-I mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush on you when I first met ya!","I know, Monica told me."
4949,"So, will you talk to him?",I don't know Rach.
4950,"Oh, come on! I'll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.",One! No ten! You said ten! You can't take that back!
4951,"Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?","I don't know. You uh, you got something for me?"
4952,,Ten. Okay. Now Tag there's such a thing as to many women.
4953,Really?,"Yeah, for you!"
4954,You guys make a very attractive couple.,"Yeah, we look great together."
4955,Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!,"Y'know, we don't have to imagine."
4956,I'm marrying her.,We'll just see.
4957,Die Hard still great!,"Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?"
4958,What'd you rent?,Die Hard 2.
4959,"Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.","Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!"
4960,"Joey, we just saw it!",And?
4961,And it'll be cool to see it again! Yeah!,Die Hard!!!!!!
4962,"No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.",What are you talking about? Bitch.
4963,What happened?!!,"Well, I don't know!!"
4964,We fell asleep! That is all.,"Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I'd better go."
4965,I think that would be best.,"Yeah. All right, I'll talk to you later."
4966,Okay. But not about this!,No! Never! Never! Bye.
4967,,Hey! What's going on?
4968,Phoebe is gonna be Monica's maid of honor!,"Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember?"
4969,Because I cared enough to lie!,"Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you'd handle maid of honor type situations."
4970,What are you talking about?,"Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I'm the best of the people they see, they give me the part."
4971,"Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?","Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges."
4972,"Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio.",Hi.
4973,"Just uh, brought back your videos.","Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before."
4974,No! No we don't!,"Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!"
4975,I... I don't know what you are talking about.,Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
4976,I've had better.,Okay! When?!
4977,All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!,Uh-huh!
4978,I've said it! Okay?! But it's over Joey!,I want to do it again.
4979,We can't do it again.,Why not?
4980,Because it's weird!,Fine! Do you want something to drink?
4981,"Sure, what do you got?",Warm milk and Excedrin P.M.
4982,,"Okay, all right, this is how it's going to work. We're gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest."
4983,"No, 10 is the highest.",Why is 10 the highest?
4984,"Because It's The Highest. Situation No.1 You're with Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go!",I don't want to marry Chandler!
4985,"Okay, uh...",I've got cold feet.
4986,...it's gonna be okay!,"No, one man for the rest of my life? I don't know if I can do it! This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey!"
4987,"Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y'know, it's-it's just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don't get to keep the gifts.","Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!"
4988,Oh!,"Okay, Phoebe..."
4989,Yes! Your honor?,"""We're now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, """"I do"""" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!"""
4990,Oh!,Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!
4991,"Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as... Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh... I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.",Oh! That's nice.
4992,"Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I've known them separately and I've known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.",Wow. Good speech.
4993,"Okay Phoebe, I guess you're next although I really don't see the point.",Yeah.
4994,,And she's back in the game.
4995,,"All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel-Damnit!"
4996,"Rach, it's gonna be okay! You guys are the best!","Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me."
4997,Yeah?,Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.
4998,Why-why would I care about that?,"No reason, I'm just saying that uh... That's where I'll be."
4999,,Great nap.
5000,,Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God!
5001,,Morning!
5002,"Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?",Pretty good.
5003,"Oh good. Ahhh! My God, sorry!","Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I'm late for work."
5004,What-what?! You're gonna leave this person with me?!,"Yeah-Hey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship; that'd be great."
5005,Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!,"Just casually slip it in, y'know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I'm a loner-No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me."
5006,"Y'know what? That's a lot to remember, can't I just tell her you're a pig?","Hey, I'm gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He'd even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he'd make extras and leave 'em for me."
5007,"Well forget it, I'm not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.","Fine! Now, where'd we land on those pancakes?"
5008,,Hey! What's up?
5009,Hey!,"Hey-hey, who's your friend? Hey!!"
5010,Hey Joey!,Erin! Still here!
5011,"Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!",Why wouldn't ya? Erin is great! Then-then there's you guys.
5012,Bye Joey. Last night was fun.,"Yeah. I'll uh, I'll call ya."
5013,And call me!,"Okay, good to see you again."
5014,Bye.,Bye-bye.
5015,,"So, system kinda broke down huh?!"
5016,We want you to marry her!,What?!!
5017,She is so amazing! You have no idea.,No idea? Who do you think brought her here?
5018,"Joey, she's so cool. She speaks four languages.","Man, do you know what guys want!"
5019,"Look Joey, come on she's so perfect for you! I mean she's sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.","My beers?! Look you guys, she's a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time, but I just-I don't see it going anywhere."
5020,"Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.","Look I'm sorry you guys, I-I just don't think so."
5021,Fine.,"Hey, don't start judging me! Huh? You're the one who's in love with her assistant! Huh? And you, you're the one having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!"
5022,"Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it's like uh-a thing!","Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?"
5023,Oh for cryin' out loud!,"All right, so we should go catch our movie."
5024,Well now what's the rush?,I like to see the previews. The candy.
5025,Hey!,Hey!
5026,Joey.,Erin.
5027,Oh no.,What party?
5028,A birthday party.,Who's birthday party?
5029,Allison's birthday party.,"Oh, and how is Allison?"
5030,Wait a minute! Why don't you guys do something?!,"Yeah, look how that worked out."
5031,,Hey.
5032,How did it go with Erin?,"Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!"
5033,"Yay!! Oh so, you're not, you're not mad at us anymore?","No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Y'know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous."
5034,Didn't you sleep together?,"Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that's a..."
5035,"Oh my God! Listen to you talkin' about having kids. Oh my Joey. Oh, please don't get married before I do.",Okay.
5036,,How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!
5037,What about Benitez?,What about Game 1 of the Series?
5038,What about shut up?,You shut up! I love arguing with her. I'll be right back.
5039,"Oh well, I guess Italian isn't one of the four languages you speak.",Hey! You wanna go?
5040,"Yeah, let's go.",Okay. See you guys later.
5041,"Yeah, see ya.","Hey, thank you so much."
5042,,Hey!
5043,"So how was, how was your date?","Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still... And guess what, I'm thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts."
5044,Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?,"No-no-no-no-no! It's a surprise, but it's gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while."
5045,"Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, she's not lookin' for a serious relationship.",Where are you gettin' this?
5046,"Well, she told me. She said she's kinda a loner.",Oh. Oh.
5047,Joey...,"No hey Rach, it's cool okay? Y'know I'm a loner too! Right?"
5048,Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell 'em you're not looking for a relationship.,"No! No. Don't do that, just next time make sure she really likes me."
5049,Well that too. Joey?,Yeah?
5050,Do you want some pancakes?,Finally!
5051,"No, no, no. No-no-no.",Shhhh!
5052,"Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in...vegetables, Joey?",Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
5053,"Wow, how many have you got?",Fifty-six!
5054,,Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!
5055,What? That's impossible.,"46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?"
5056,You're on!,"All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have."
5057,"Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?","But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?"
5058,"Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.","Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States."
5059,"Seriously, it's moving!",What the hell is in there?
5060,What dog? There-there's no dog here.,Yeah that dog left!
5061,"Okay, it's um...",Don't do it!
5062,Why?,Told ya.
5063,"Okay, you are new!","Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin' ice cream."
5064,Really? I'd say 3 to 4.,Half hour.
5065,"When it's your assistant, I would say never.","All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point."
5066,Huh. A moo-point?,"Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo."
5067,"You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.","Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside."
5068,"Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out!","All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!"
5069,What?,"Street noise drowned any of that out? No, all right, I see you later, okay..."
5070,"Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend...Phyllis...take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.","Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! What's the matter?"
5071,"Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.","So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero."
5072,"Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?","Chandler, it's like a big gerbil."
5073,And that doesn't scare you?,"Ross, you need some help?"
5074,"From you? Yes, please!","First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!"
5075,,Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.
5076,"Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out","If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah."
5077,Hi!,Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!
5078,"Oh no, the dog's not going to be there!",You think?
5079,Hey! What are you guys doing?,Hey.
5080,But we don't know the neighbors.,"I do. There's uh, let's see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I've Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty."
5081,,Yeah?
5082,Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!,"Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!"
5083,They love my candy? Oh man!!! I've gotta go make more!!,"Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might've happened to a huge chunk of it."
5084,"Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.",Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
5085,"Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!",Those two only had each other!
5086,"Oh yeah! I saw her walkin' it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.","Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin' it by the park."
5087,,Hey Pheebs?
5088,"Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!",Hey Rach?
5089,Yeah?,That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like this?
5090,Ugh!,"Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford porn."
5091,"Please, can't you help me out?","Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?"
5092,We're waiting for the candy. Bring out the candy!,Yeah lady! Give us candy!!
5093,Joey!,What's up buddy?
5094,What are you doing?,Waiting for candy.
5095,No not Candy Lady.,"Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!"
5096,"All right, y'know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! You've ruined it! Go home! You've ruined it! You've ruined it!","That's right, it's all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You ruined it!"
5097,"I'm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.","Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don't know..."
5098,,Hey.

5104,Hey!,Here. Now I only owe you $49.50.
5105,"Joey, y'know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.",What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?
5106,"Hey, Joey, I got you another present.","Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! Okay, what is it?"
5107,"What are you talking about? I love them! Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?","Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey!"
5108,,Merry Christmas!
5109,I got it!,Is it back in the cage?
5110,Its back in cage!,Cage closed?
5111,,"All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y'know I'm in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I'm not brain dead."
5112,So...,"Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it's just not my character that's not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?"
5113,Absolutely!,I'll see you at 8:00.
5114,"Hey, y'know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron!",Hey!
5115,Oh! Here's Joseph Francis!,Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!
5116,So what?! That doesn't give you the right to ditch me!,"Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!"
5117,"I don't accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can't just be a way to kill time 'til you meet someone better! Y'know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this is for life!",Wow! I'm so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.
5118,"Well, it does.","Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I'm sorry. How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I'll pay for myself!"
5119,"Hey Joe, while you're over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?",The Ross-Is that back?!!
5120,,Awww! Mel Torme died.
5121,"Joey, that paper's like a year old!",Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody's sale is over?!
5122,Hey.,Hey.
5123,"""Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn't invited and you got """"and guest?!""""""","Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross's behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y'know, since she has a chance to get on broad back..."
5124,"Okay, all right, I'll take you. I'll go call Joan.","Aww that's nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life."
5125,"I'm full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I'll regret it.",Hey!
5126,Hey!,What do you got there?
5127,What are you doing tonight?,Huh? Uh...
5128,Dude! Dude!,"Oh! Sorry. Uh, I've got those plans with Phoebe, why?"
5129,"Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.",What?! Tonight?!
5130,That's what Monica said.,After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think she's trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
5131,And for you sir?,"Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin' here?"
5132,"It's uh, it's already been roasted.","Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again."
5133,Actually we're out of the lobster ravioli.,"Oh well, that changes everything! Y'know what Pheebs?"
5134,Huh?,"You were right before. I mean, friends are so important."
5135,"Yeah, I'm very wise. I know.",Y'know-y'know what I really want?
5136,What?,"Is to have a long, long talk. Y'know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up."
5137,Any progress?,Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
5138,"God Joey, this is taking forever!",What's the rush? What?
5139,W-w-I just-it's that-I have-y'know I have-I have an appointment. And it's very important.,"Whoa-whoa, what is it?"
5140,Well... It's a date.,"A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn't schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!"
5141,"Come on Joey, don't make me feel badly about this.","No, I'm gonna!! That's right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin' out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, you're doing the same thing!"
5142,"That-It's not the same thing! This is totally different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, he's very special to me.","Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!"
5143,She was?,"Well, she graduated from high school!"
5144,"Okay, whatever. Y'know what? I don't have time have time to convince you because he's only here for four hours, and I'm gonna go see him!",Fine!
5145,Yeah!,Fine!
5146,Yeah!,"What are you still doin' here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!"
5147,"Okay, now's not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.","No! No! No Pheebs, I'm not gonna yell at you. I just y'know, started thinking about you and David and I...remember how bummed you were the first time he left. And I just... Oh Pheebs, come here. Are you okay?"
5148,No I'm not okay. The only guy I've ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never...I may never see him again.,"Hey, y'know you could always visit him."
5149,"Oh right, like they're gonna let me have a passport.",Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
5150,"Well-But-Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y'know before he does, then he can come back.",I can give it a shot.
5151,,"All right, what are we havin'?"
5152,"Man, look at all those stars! Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesn't it?",Y'know what else makes you wonder?
5153,Huh?,Check out the rack on this chick!
5154,"No, I'm not!",Then why are you wearing Monica's jacket?
5155,Oh.,Ross!
5156,What?,"Come here, check this out!"
5157,What? Is it the comet?,"No! No-no. Look, there's a bug stuck in tar right here."
5158,"Joey come-I can't believe-I bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of nature's most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!","Y'know, there's two women dude."
5159,Show me where?,Right-right up here.
5160,Joey where's the pipe that was holding the door open?,"I don't know! Yeah, I do."
5161,Joey!,What?! All right-Hey! Don't look at me! You're the one who wanted to come up and look for some stupid Burger King comet!
5162,"It's called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? Hey! Hey! Bapstein was a very well respected astronomer!",Oh no! No! No!
5163,Rachel!! Monica!!,Come on!
5164,I can't believe this!!,"All right well, y'know...I guess we know what we have to do to get down."
5165,"Yeah, I guess we don't have a choice. Help us! Please help us! We're stuck up on the roof and we can't get down!!!",Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape.
5166,,"All right, it won't go down any further. It's stuck."
5167,"Ugh. Well, we're just gonna have to jump. Yeah. Now, we're gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there...you go up to the roof and you let me in.",Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!
5168,"Yeah! Oh yeah, you'll be fine! It-it'll be uh, just like bungy jumping. Y'know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won't.",What if I smack my head on the concrete?
5169,"Well, I'm gonna lie to you Joey, it's a possibility.","I don't know Ross! I-I tell you what, let's flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?"
5170,"Oh, all right. Tails! Can you-can you see what it is?",No.
5171,"Okay. Well, you be careful.","What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I'm not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can't go if I break my leg."
5172,Well I'm jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won't have a father if-if I die!,"Well all right so, it looks like we're even!"
5173,,"""Man, I'm starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! """"Do you want soup or salad?"""" Both! Always order both!"""
5174,"Y'know, y'know I'm lookin' and I don't think anyone's home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y'know explain later.",Yeah? Really? No one's home?
5175,"Okay, do-do you have a good grip?",Yeah!
5176,"Okay, I'm going to start climb down you now.",All right! Just hurry up!
5177,Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we're face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we're-we're butt to face.,I think face to face.
5178,I would say that.,"Face to face, yeah!"
5179,"Okay, here I go.",All right.
5180,,Oh my... How much do you weigh Ross?!
5181,,"Y'know, when we talked about face to face, I don't think we thought it all the way through."
5182,So what do you want me to do?,"Well, just shimmy down me and drop!"
5183,Hi.,Hi.
5184,M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me.,Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
5185,It's still looks pretty far!,It's not that far! Just drop!
5186,,"Ross, you should know that my pants are startin' to come down and I'm not wearing any underwear!"
5187,,Hey.
5188,Hey.,What are you doing?
5189,"Well, y'know I was thinking of moving the couch over here.",Why would you want to do that?
5190,So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.,"Rach, there is a decent place to..."
5191,And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.,No. No. No.
5192,No?,No. Rosita does not move.
5193,"I'm sorry, Rosita? As in...",As in Rosita does not move.
5194,"Joey, it's just a chair! What's the big deal?",The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it's at the perfect angle so you don't get any glare coming of off Stevie.
5195,Stevie the TV?,Is there a problem?
5196,"Joey, Joey I am so sorry.","I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don't, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?"
5197,"Okay, come on-Joey, I'll buy you a new one! All right? We'll go down to the store right now and we'll-we'll get you a new chair.",She's not even cold yet!
5198,"But don't you think Rosita would've wanted you to move on? I mean y'know, she did always put...your comfort first.",That's true.
5199,Okay? You ready?,"Yeah, I... I don't want Stevie to see her like this."
5200,You will like it!,No I won't.
5201,You don't even know!,"Because, I know what I like and what I don't like! It's not the same thing!"
5202,"Well look, if you don't like this...",I don't know why you say that so soon.
5203,"Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, y'know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.",Francette? What is she? A couch?
5204,,Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
5205,"Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y'know, start the heeling process?","Well, I guess you're right. Maybe, maybe I'll take her down to the incinerator. It's gonna be so said, and kinda cool. She's heeled!"
5206,That's weird.,"No it's not weird, it's a miracle!"
5207,It's not a miracle Joey! I'm sure there's some explanation.,"Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!"
5208,"Joey, I really don't...",Can you tell me how this happened?
5209,Well no.,Miracle!
5210,"No, y'know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!",Someone like an...angel?
5211,"That's right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair.",Get your non-believer ass outta my chair!
5212,I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!,"Yeah, me too."
5213,"Hey, how's...how's the uh, miracle chair?",Fine.
5214,"Yeah? Wow! Y'know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!",No. Really?
5215,Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!,My chair heels itself.
5216,,"Well, it looks like it wasn't heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now!"
5217,Joey you broke my chair!!,Your chair?!
5218,"Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!","So, there was no miracle?!"
5219,"No Joe, no miracle.",Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I'm so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
5220,,How do you figure?
5221,,That's right!
5222,,Yeah! We are!
5223,,Oh yeah.
5224,Ahhhh....,Ahhh...... Eh?
5225,Hey!,Hey!
5226,Ms. Green would like to establish some ground rules before she comes out. She would appreciate it if you don't use the words old or downhill or they still look pretty damn good.,They do!
5227,"Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?","Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal."
5228,,Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not me!!
5229,,And now Chandler! We're all gettin' so old! Why are you doing this to us?!
5230,"Rach, you're in a great place in your life. Come on, you've got a great job! Good friends...","Yeah, you're roommate is a soap opera star."
5231,That's not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars.,"Hey, what's the horsepower on this thing?"
5232,Would you put that back on?! Monica's gonna be here any minute!,But it hurt's my Joey's Apple.
5233,Is this yours?,Well actually...
5234,No-no-no! It's mine! It's-it's mine.,"Dude, you soooo need this car."
5235,"Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.",Yep.
5236,Okay.,"Now that you're a couple, we don't get two presents from you guys?"
5237,,Will you quit hoggin' it!
5238,Oh that's great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? There we go.,Hey! Are those crab cakes? Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
5239,"Okay quick, help me get this off!",Yeah!!
5240,I lost a whole year! I can't believe it! This is so unfair!,"Oh, I don't know Pheebs. It'll be okay."
5241,"Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?",That's not gonna happen. No. Because we have a new deal!
5242,"Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I...I haven't done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!",Like what?
5243,"Hey. Oh, poor Pheebs.","Hey, y'know what you guys? I think I'm gonna go walk her home."
5244,,"Pheebs! Wait up! Listen uh, close your eyes. Maybe that's one thing you can cross off your list."
5245,,"Oh, and plus I'm 1/16th Portuguese."
5246,"Hey Joey, can I...","Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!"
5247,"Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag.","Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?"
5248,"Whatever! Okay, I'm not your mother.",Okay!
5249,Not in the street!!,Yes!
5250,You did the right thing.,I don't like this anymore.
5251,"God, do you realize in ten years we're gonna be 40?",Why God?! Why are you doing this to us?!
5252,Yes! My baby's finally free!,All-all right! Start it up! Let's go!
5253,You wanna buy a car?,No.
5254,"Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking.",Hey!
5255,Hey!,"So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and..."
5256,What is DOOL?,"Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you're not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!"
5257,That's great!,"And-and-and not only that, I'm gettin' a new brain!!"
5258,"Wait, what do you mean you're getting a new brain?","Oh well, they're killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body."
5259,What? A brain transplant?!,"Yes, it's a highly controversial procedure."
5260,It's ridiculous!,"Well, I think it's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three and a half months."
5261,Who are they killing off?,"Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart."
5262,She's my favorite character on DOOL.,Nice.
5263,"Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.","Oh, tell me about it. And she's been on the show forever, it's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes."
5264,"""Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the """"brain transplant,"""" you are going to be her?""","Yes, but in Drake Remoray's body. Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!"
5265,,That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?
5266,Can I get some ice here?!,"Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are."
5267,You're not the fan who's dying are you?,Say what?
5268,"I'm supposed to meet and hug a fan whose dying, but that's not supposed to be until later!","No. No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I'm the guy in the coma!"
5269,Oh that was a real person?!,"An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me..."
5270,I-I-I'm leaving the show?,I don't know. Why? Did you hear something?
5271,Who told you that?,"Oh uh, one of the writers."
5272,Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?,Umm...
5273,Y'know what? It doesn't matter! Because it is not true!,Okay.
5274,"And if it were true, how dare you come to me ask me for tips about a character that I've been playing for 20 years-I'll give you a tip!",Ms. Monroe... Oh there you go.
5275,,So you like the nachos uh? Myself I'm partial to...
5276,I'm 16.,See you in 2003.
5277,"You're absolutely right they are writing me out of the show. They don't know exactly when it's going to happen, but apparently going to be very soon and that's it.","I'm so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show."
5278,"Yeah, thanks.",No I mean it! I can't believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!
5279,Oh you're right. Thank you! What's your name again?,Joey.
5280,I'm having a conversation here! You were saying?,"Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I'm really nervous about-about being you. Y'know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y'know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?"
5281,"All right Joey, I will help you. Not because I-I owe it to this stupid show, but because I owe it to Jessica.",Oh that's great! Oh thank you so much!
5282,You're so welcome.,"""Hey! Now, I've been watching some tapes, how's this? """"Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again! Ever!!"""""""
5283,Is that supposed to be me?,Yeah.
5284,Yeah but Jessica doesn't have an English accent.,I can do an English accent?! That baby's going on my resume!
5285,"So, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. So, when Jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room. You try.",Okay! All right!
5286,"No, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! He's not finding it out for the first time! So, try it again.",Okay. Okay.
5287,"Right. He's not angry at the room either. Try it again, he owns it! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!! All right, it's a little weird, but it's getting better. Oh well, I'm gonna miss this woman so much. I don't know what I'm going to do! I mean, it's been 20 years of my life.","Oh well-Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y'know? It'll-it'll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You're so talented."
5288,"I am. I am, but I don't know you know. An actor of a certain age is not that easy.","Hey that's not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb-Angelina Jolie!"
5289,"I probably should've just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but y'know I just got so comfy here! And... Ohh, I turned down some amazing work!",Like-like what?
5290,"Well, let's just say if I left 15 years ago, the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today!",Wow!
5291,"But... Well now, now's a different time for me.","""Oh hey come on, don't-don't-don't do this! Umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I'm thinking, """"Boy, she-she is a great actress!"""" Uh but-but, I am also thinking, """"She is hot!"""""""
5292,You think I'm hot?,You own the room. We should probably get-get uh...
5293,"Oh yeah-yeah, we should get the... So when Jessica kisses a man, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the man's face.","Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that 'cause she's so passionate?"
5294,No! It's because that way the camera only sees her! Do you wanna try it?,Yeah! Okay.
5295,"Well, you certainly own that room.","Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you."
5296,Hi.,Hey!
5297,MONICA!!!! MONICA!!!!,"That uh, that is my roommate Rachel."
5298,Oh that explains all the women's underwear.,Sure. Yep.
5299,"God. You seem really, really nice.","Okay, bye-bye."
5300,I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.,"All right, here we go."
5301,Nice to meet you! My God you're great!,Thanks for stopping by. See ya! I-I am so sorry. I...
5302,"Oh no-no-no-no, being adored. I'm used to it, don't worry about it.",Oh my God!
5303,What?,They sent me today's script! They never send the script!
5304,They don't?,"Well no, I'm just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! Oh..."
5305,How does it happen?,"Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence."
5306,Ah what?! Jessica hates horses!,"Yeah well, I'm guessing after this she's not going to be crazy about electricity either."
5307,"I can't believe she's really gone. Look around you, all of this is ours.",I don't think so.
5308,"That was so wonderful! Ohh, I think that you're a better Jessica than I ever was!",Oh noo...
5309,"Well of course not, but you were very good.",Thanks!
5310,And guess what? Good news! I got another job!,Great! Hey! All right! Well-well what is it?!
5311,A film in Guadalajara!,The airport?
5312,No that's La Guardia. This is Mexico.,"Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?"
5313,Eight months.,That's a really long time.
5314,"Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a few places down there.","Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first. And I just got what you meant again-That is-I tell ya, that is a tricky one!"
5315,"That is a tricky one. Well, Joey I really wanna thank you. You've, well you made a very difficult time for me a little less painful.",Good luck.
5316,Yes! A friend of mine did it and it's totally legal!,I call it!!
5317,Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.,Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
5318,,"So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?"
5319,We're never gonna find anybody.,Well then let me do it!
5320,Joe...,"No-no-no! Look, I've been thinking about it. I'm an actor right? So I won't get nervous talking in front of people."
5321,Joey look it's really sweet...,"No-no-no-no look no! I won't spit, and I won't stare at Monica's breasts! Y'know? Everyone knows I'm an ass man!"
5322,That is true.,"Yeah and the most important thing is that it won't be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It'll be me! And I swear I'll do a really good job. Plus, y'know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me."
5323,It might be kinda cool.,So I can do it?
5324,Yeah you can do it.,"All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?"
5325,Yeah.,Okay.
5326,Oh.,Oh! My head! Oh! Oh!
5327,In case it happens.,Hey!
5328,Hey!,Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani!
5329,You did it! You got ordained?!,"Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!"
5330,"Okay, then I must be disoriented.","Anyway, I started working on what I'm going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?"
5331,Yeah!,"""Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so... """"We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share."""" Eh? """"It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving."""" """"We too can share and love and have and receive."""""""
5332,"Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!","Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?"
5333,Yeah. O-okay.,"""""""When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and..."""" And then I can't think of a good word for right here."""
5334,How about receiving?,Yes!
5335,"See Joe, not that that's not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y'know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!","Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?"
5336,"See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y'know, romantic stories. Nice stories.","""Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I'll talk about London! Y'know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won't say hooked up. I'll say, """"Began their beautiful journey..."""""""
5337,There you go!,"""""""...by doin' it."""""""
5338,Joe?,"Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing y'know you're in the bathtub together and she's feeding you strawberries?"
5339,Isn't that what happened with you and the bride's maid?,Yeah!! I call that London style.
5340,"No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy that I was Ross's mom.",Oh.
5341,"And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much...",Yeah baby!
5342,And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.,Oh.
5343,But then later that night...,Yeah baby!
5344,Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey!,Hey!
5345,Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e...,"Oh, dude I'm so sorry!"
5346,No! No! No!,"Hey no-no-no-no! It's cool! It's cool! I-I'll only be a second, I'm still with my bride's maid, I just-Where are those condoms you brought?"
5347,They're in my bag over there.,Ah.
5348,"Uh, could you leave me one?",For just you?
5349,Yeah.,"Hey listen, why don't you come downstairs with me? There's some really nice girls down there."
5350,No I-I-I'm fine.,"All right, here you go buddy. Go nuts."
5351,,"That's what that was?! 'Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me."
5352,"Okay, can we change the topic? Because it's really doing nothing for me.",Oh... Can you imagine if I hadn't left you that last one? You two might've never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It's like it was in the stars!
5353,"Okay, fine but please don't be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted...just sex. So, when I...went to your room that night...I was actually looking...for Joey.",Yeah baby! No baby!
5354,Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!,And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv-
5355,"Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!","Hey! Now I'm a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!"
5356,Look there is no way you're doing this wedding now. Okay?,"What?! That's not fair! It's not my fault! I was off with my bride's maid! And who's to say I would've even said yes?! I mean I would've said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!"
5357,"It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin.",This is crazy.
5358,,Hey.
5359,Hey. Do you want this scone? It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!,"Chandler, come on nothing even happened!"
5360,"Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding...","No-hey-no! If you don't want me to do it, I except that. I don't care about that. I just...I don't want you to be upset."
5361,How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!,"Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! You're so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, 'cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y'know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just...it-it fits. Y'know? And you just know it's gonna last forever."
5362,That's what you should say.,What?
5363,When you're marrying us; that's what you should say.,Really? I can do it?
5364,I'd love it if you would do it.,Hey!
5365,But those are the words! Those exact words!,"Well I don't know remember exactly but, it's-it's pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving."
5366,,Hey!
5367,Hey-hey.,So are guys doing okay?
5368,,What's my little chef got for me tonight?
5369,Your favorite!,"Ho-ho-ho, fried stuff with cheese!"
5370,Yep! And lot's of it!,Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here. Okay.
5371,,Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! How you doin'?
5372,,Here you go.
5373,Oh my God! This is a six-hour pill! That's it! I'm out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief!,Good for you!
5374,So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six.,Food? Uh-huh gimme!
5375,Staying out of the way.,"This is impossible Monica, why don't you just pick all 15?"
5376,There were only twelve.,"Oh yeah, I added three."
5377,What are peanut butter fingers?!,Oh yeah...
5378,,"Hi! You uh, movin' in or movin' out?"
5379,I'm moving in.,"Oh uh, can I give you a hand?"
5380,Oh okay. But y'know what? Be careful. Because a guy was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back.,Boyfriend?
5381,No.,I'm Joey.
5382,Kristen.,"Oh wow, what a beautiful name! What is it again?"
5383,Kristen.,Got it! So...
5384,"So uh, do you live around here?",Yeah! Yeah! Right down there. Hey listen; let me give you a little tip. Do not take a nap on this stoop or you can wake up with your shoes gone.
5385,I'll remember that.,"Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?"
5386,"Oh I, I have plans tonight.",Oh.
5387,But how about tomorrow?,"Sounds great! Okay all right, well where does this go?"
5388,"You look strong, why don't I take that and you grab one of the boxes.","Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I'll grab this one."
5389,"Yeah in fact, I'm gonna go call her right now. And I'll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says...",Hey Chandler!
5390,Hey!,"Listen, sorry I didn't stop by last night but I had a date."
5391,"Uh Joe, when it's one o'clock in the morning and you don't come by? That's okay!","Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!"
5392,Really? Right across the street?,Yeah!
5393,When'd you meet her?,Two days ago.
5394,Excellent! Y'know Ross met somebody too!,Oh yeah?
5395,Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross's situation?,"Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy. But, I don't know, I'm not to worried about it."
5396,"So this is nice! I wish I didn't have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. Oh uh, by the way, what's the name the girl you're dating?",Kristen Lang.
5397,Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.,"Obviously! So, how do we decide?"
5398,"Well now let's-let's look at this objectively, I think I should date her...","Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I'm the one who dates her."
5399,"That's interesting, but check this out. I date her...",Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction...
5400,"Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.",Yeah well we should order some food then.
5401,"No Joey! Look why don't, why don't we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we'll each go out with her one more time. And-and we'll see who she likes best.",That sounds fair.
5402,Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street...,Ah yeah-wait a second now! Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
5403,"Well sorry, that's what I do on dates.","All right, well I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates."
5404,So let's decide on the spending limit...,"Yeah. Uh, ...a slice......six dollars?"
5405,I was thinking more like a hundred.,Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
5406,,Hey!
5407,Hey! What's up?,"I just wanted to come by and y'know, wish you good luck on your date."
5408,Oh thanks!,Yeah. What time are you meeting her?
5409,We have 8:00 reservations at Grammercy Bistero.,"Wow, that's in like 20 minutes. You'd better get dressed."
5410,I am dressed.,Oh. Well good! For me. What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?
5411,I have an oily T-zone!,"Okay dude! Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers."
5412,That's right.,You spent a hundred dollars. That's the limit. You're screwed!
5413,"Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So techincally, technically I didn't break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.",Oh-oh! So that's the way it's gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y'know!
5414,Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?,I don't know.
5415,Why am I not surprised?,Y'know what Ross? I'm not gonna let you get away with this!
5416,I don't think you have much choice.,Well we'll see!
5417,Bye-bye!,Yeah bye-bye! Hey! So just a light layer?
5418,Oh yeah it's fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.,Kristen?
5419,Joey!,Hi!
5420,Hi! What are you doing here?,"Oh I like this place. And technically, technically I'm not breaking any rules so I..."
5421,"Well uh, Ross? This is Joey. Joey? Ross.",Hi!
5422,Yeah. So...,Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks!
5423,"That's right! That's right, don't you play a woman?",A woman in a man's body.
5424,Much better.,"So y'know Ross it's funny 'cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?"
5425,"That's right! Wait no, Ben.",So you've just married the one time then?
5426,You said the waiter ate my crab cake.,"Yeah. So uh Ross, well now-why did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?"
5427,Do you two know each other?,No. No.
5428,No. No.,No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
5429,Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?,Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
5430,Hey you leave Marcel out of this!,Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
5431,Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!,Monkey lover!
5432,,When do you think we lost her?
5433,"Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we're gonna have younger looking skin!","Yeah! Y'know, she could use a little... Oh nice shot!!!"
5434,,Hey! You guys! You're not gonna believe this! I just got off the phone with my agent...
5435,"Oh my God! I'm sorry, too soon. You go.",Okay. I got nominated for my part on Days of Our Lives!

5439,Oh my God! Oh my God!! That is like the third most prestigious soap opera award there is!,"Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who I'm taking to the awards."

5446,Ohh that's great!,Yeah!
5447,"So you'll definitely get onstage, even if you don't win.",What you-you don't think I'm gonna win?
5448,"Well of course I do! But y'know, favorite returning character is a tough category Joey. I mean you're up against the guy who survived his own cremation.","Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it's just...I've never even been nominated before! I want it so much."
5449,"Well Joey, you'll probably get it. But you should probably your-your gracious loser face. Y'know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y'know? So it's sorta like...",Hey!
5450,Y'know?,You practice losing the Grammies too?
5451,"Oh no, at the Grammies I always win.",Ah.
5452,Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?,Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
5453,There's this kid in my class who said he's in love with me.,Whoa!
5454,Whoa what?,Ross has a boyfriend.
5455,Yeah.,How'd you get over that teacher?
5456,I didn't. I got under him.,Problem solved.
5457,,This is it! This is my category.
5458,I know! My God! Do you have your speech?,"Yeah, I got my speech!"

5460,"Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!",Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?

From One Life to Live Mary Loren Bishop , from All My Children Sarah Mchann, and from Days of Our Lives Jessica Ashley. And the winner is......Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives. Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldn't be with us tonight so I'll be accepting this award on her behalf. And I'm sure that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. She'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel who's sittin' right there!"
5464,Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!,"Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won!"
5465,Oh my God you stole her award!,"No-no! No, I'm accepting it on her behalf."
5466,Joey I don't think you know what behalf means.,"""Sure I do! It's a verb! As in, """"I behalfin' it!"""""""
5467,"Joey, you have got to take this back!",But why?! I should've won one and I really want it and she didn't even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy.
5468,No! Joey!,Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of 'em.
5469,Do you really want an award you didn't win?,"No! I want an award I did win! But nobody's giving me any of those! Plus-Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there right? When people come over they'll see it and they'll think I won it."
5470,Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!,I can scratch that right off.
5471,"Joey no, this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You don't want to win an award this way. You're very talented. And someday you're gonna win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something.",All right!
5472,All right? Thank you.,I'll take it back tomorrow.
5473,,If I can't have it you can't have it!
5474,I cannot believe I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley!,Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.
5475,,Hey Jessica.
5476,Hey Jess.,"Ah, this is my friend Rachel."
5477,'Sup?,"Uh listen, here's your Soapie. I accepted it for ya."
5478,Oh my God! I won! Do you have any idea what this means?!,"Well, that-that-that's it? You're gonna, you're gonna put it on your self or anything?"
5479,"No, I try to save that for real awards. Now, if you'll excuse me.",Take it back?
5480,Absolutely.,Y-y-yeah! Yeah you do.
5481,Oh hey! How was your audition?,"I'm sorry, do I know you?"
5482,What are you doing?,"Nothing, I'm just practicing blowing you off because I'm gonna be a big movie star!"
5483,Oh! You got it?!,"Well, no not yet. But the audition went really good."
5484,What was it for?,"Oh, it's this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It's really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese."
5485,"The next, next?","Yeah, there's this guy from Chicago who's supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy's right after him. Hello!"
5486,Joey! It's Estelle! I just talked to the casting people; they loved you!,They loved me!
5487,"Yeah, they wanna see you again tomorrow.",Oh my God!
5488,There's just one thing. Do you have a problem with full frontal nudity?,"Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! Oh. Uh, okay uh let me call you back."
5489,What's the matter?,They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
5490,Wow!,I know! My grandmother's gonna see this!
5491,Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?,"I don't know! It's not like it's porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y'know? And the nudity is really important to the story."
5492,That's what you say about porn.,You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back.
5493,No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!,Well that's true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character's catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It's really sweet and-and tender.
5494,,"Hey, I'm back!"
5495,Hi-hi Joey.,"Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?"
5496,"Actually, I tried to call to you. You didn't need to come down here today.","Oh great! Y'know I would've been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y'know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!"
5497,Wait Joey! You didn't need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.,And scene! Huh? Wasn't that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?
5498,"Well, the director thinks you're really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.",Wow! Sure! That's great!
5499,Oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.,"Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it's handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold."
5500,"Terrific! Well uh, there's one more thing. Uhh, uh it's really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. Yeah and so in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how she's never seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish. So...",So...What?
5501,"So uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish. Do you know what I'm saying?",Yes!
5502,Okay.,No. What?
5503,An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not be...,Barmifsaed?
5504,So to get this part you can't be?,Nope.
5505,But you are?,Yep.
5506,But you told them you weren't?,That's right.
5507,Wow! Wow! And it's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with? What were you thinking?,"I don't know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell 'em you can! And just figure out how to do it later."
5508,Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to...grow a turtleneck!,I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
5509,"Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!",I just have to call my agent and tell her I can't do the part.
5510,Unless!,Unless what?
5511,"Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.",Like what?
5512,"Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.",Wow! This looks great!
5513,"Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. Umm, this one is made of bologna.",And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
5514,"Oh, just until the glue dries.",Thank God!
5515,"Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.",Ah.
5516,"Okay? Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it's gonna shrink.",Well maybe we just take that one away.
5517,"I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that's really just for me. Okay. So, why don't you go into your room and try these on and we'll see-get a better idea of what's gonna work.","Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird."
5518,,Ow!
5519,Toothpick?,Yeah.
5520,What are you trying on now?,The fruit roll up.
5521,And?,Delicious.
5522,Joey!,Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!
5523,What?! Which one?!,The Silly Putty! It's not so silly anymore!
5524,,"And what's cool is, the character is from Naples, right?"
5525,Yeah.,My whole family's from Naples!
5526,"Joey, this is awkward part.","Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. I totally understand. You need to y'know make sure I don't have any horrible scars or tattoos. Don't you worry; I have nothing to hide. So there you go, that's me. One hundred percent natural! I tell ya, that has never happened before."
5527,"Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?",Probably Monica and Chandler.
5528,Okay!,Hey guys! Look who's back! It's Ray-ray!
5529,"Wait a minute, she isn't... She's not the one who you...",Who you what? Who you what?!
5530,Wow!,Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who you-what?!!
5531,What?!,What?!
5532,"Chandler, relax it's not a contest. Certainly not a close one.",Hello!
5533,Hey!,Hey Rach.
5534,"Okay, I think that's it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they're having fun don't they?","Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?"
5535,"Oh! Let's see, well...if this is the wedding hall then umm you're parents will be at home in Queens.","What they're not invited?! Oh no, that's terrible! They're gonna be crushed!"
5536,Why would they think they're invited?,You got me. I don't...
5537,Joey!,"Well, I'm sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y'know? Your parents are comin'! Chandler's parents are comin'! Ross's parents are comin'!"
5538,Ross's parents are my parents!,Well-well-see? Parents are comin'!
5539,That is not a problem.,Maybe you'll order a little sangria?
5540,,We should really learn how to play the real way.
5541,I like our way. Oh! Chess!,Nice move.
5542,Hey!,Hey!
5543,"So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding, do you need one?","No, I'm performing the ceremony. I'm not wearing a tux."
5544,"Well, what are you going to wear?","Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat."
5545,Huh. Does Monica know about this?,I don't think so.
5546,"Oh, y'know what? I can't. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.",Can I come?! I won't even talk! You'll just hear the noise from my video camera.
5547,What is this? What's going on?,Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!
5548,Joey's!,Okay...
5549,Sure!,Hey. It happened!
5550,Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.,Why are you taking this away from me?
5551,Okay! All right! Yeah! 'Cause I just can't picture it.,"Oh-ho, you should get inside my head."
5552,,Hey.
5553,"Hey. Oh good-good you're here! All right, I figured it out. I'm gonna take two tables of eight, I'm gonna add your parents, and I'm gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!","Yeah, they're not coming."
5554,What?!,Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They...feel a little unwanted.
5555,"Oh that's too bad. It's true, but too bad.","Look Mon, if you could just call my mom..."
5556,Oh Joey!,"Come on! Look just-just tell-let her know that you really want them to be there. Let's not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years."
5557,No she hasn't.,Is it her fault that some of them didn't make it to you?
5558,"Well, what am I going to say?","I don't know. Just uh, just tell 'em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or-No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don't think you can blame it on them so..."
5559,"Ooh, yum!",Hey.
5560,Hey.,"Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?"
5561,The show?!,"Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it's gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?"
5562,Have you ever been to one of my weddings?,"Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it's the same day as my niece's christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. 'Cause my part's just in the beginning I'm not even in the rest of the show-Wedding!"
5563,The wedding starts at six.,"Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little 'til they get there?"
5564,You'll vamp?!,"Yeah! Yeah y'know, like warm up the crowd. Ask 'em where they're from. 'Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I'm a minis-tainer! There is no one better! There is no one greater!"
5565,The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.,"Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?"
5566,"All right that's it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I don't care!","No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They're so happy they get to be a part of your special day."
5567,"Well, you're welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming.","Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this is for party time."
5568,"Monica, there are no words... There are no words! This should not be this hard!","All right, uh... Oh hey, you've done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?"
5569,,"""Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, """"Monica..."""
5570,Monica...,"""""""...when I look back over our time together..."""""""
5571,Yeah?,"Well, I can't do everything! Look back over your time together."
5572,,Can we come it yet?! We're dying out here!
5573,,Hey!
5574,"Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.","""How is """"Monica, I love your sweet ass,"""" inappropriate?"""
5575,I can't believe they've been together for three years.,Has it been that long?!
5576,,"Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!"
5577,"I've had a very long, hard day.","Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?"
5578,"Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.",Okay.
5579,I don't know why they didn't just tell us.,I know! I mean it's not like we weren't cool about it.
5580,,You?! And-and you?!
5581,"Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!",How?! When?!
5582,It happened in London.,IN LONDON!!!
5583,The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.,But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
5584,,"All right! Man, this is unbelievable!"
5585,"Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?","Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!"
5586,Phoebe knows about us!,Well I didn't tell them!
5587,Them?! Who's them?,"Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey."
5588,Joey!,And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
5589,"I can not believe he would do that to Mon-Whoa! Joey, do they know that we know?",No.
5590,Joey!,They know you know.
5591,"God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything!",I couldn't even if I wanted too.
5592,He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.,Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!
5593,"Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.",Ooh!
5594,Okay!,"I like that! Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em!"
5595,"Joey! Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.",It's not my first time.
5596,"I just-I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!",So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
5597,"Well, things change.",I don't want them to move to a Volvo dealership!
5598,It'll be okay Joe.,"I'm sorry, I just...I like things the way they are."
5599,Looks like a fun gang.,"Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!"
5600,Hey.,Hey.
5601,"Well, we were just talkin' about you guys gettin' married and how great it is.","Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that's what you really want."
5602,Oh!,Hey!
5603,"Oh, that's beautiful.",Funny one! That's good!
5604,,What? I don't get it.
5605,Dude!,I have never known love like this.
5606,You can't do that!,If he goes first he can!
5607,Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you're done.,Hey!
5608,Hey!,"Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin' good. When do I get to take that baby out again?"
5609,Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I'll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.,"Yeah, you got a couple hours?"
5610,Hey guys!,Hey!
5611,What? Oh. Ooh. Whoa! That one kept going.,So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?
5612,Over a month.,"Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better."
5613,"Sure, I'd like that.","So uh, what's your name?"
5614,Its Jake.,"Joey. Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?"
5615,"Yeah, big fan.",Me too! There's a game on Tuesday do you wanna go?
5616,,Pheebs!
5617,Hey!,"Listen, you know how uh, when you're wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?"
5618,Yeah!,"Well, when Jake did it I saw that...he was wearing women's underwear!"
5619,I know. They were mine.,"Oh. No! No wait, that's weird!"
5620,"No, it's not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.",That's weird!
5621,I'm wearing his briefs right now.,That's...kinda hot.
5622,I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.,"Yeah, I wouldn't know about that."
5623,And! Y'know what Jake says? That women's underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.,"Yeah well next thing you know, he'll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!"
5624,There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I'm thinking even more than you.,"Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys."
5625,I'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women's underwear! I don't think you could ever do that.,Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.
5626,Okay whatever.,You've seen my huge stack of porn right?
5627,,Hey Pheebs!
5628,Hey!,Check it out. How much of a man am I?!
5629,Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.,"Y'know, I'm beginning to see what Jake was talking about."
5630,Uh-huh.,The silk? Feels really good!
5631,Huh.,Yeah! And-and things aren't as...smashed down as I thought they were gonna be.
5632,That's great Joe!,Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with men's underwear!
5633,Uh-huh.,"Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! You've got cotton, silk, lace! And y'know what I've always wondered about?"
5634,Hmm?,Pantyhose! Y'know? They way they start at your toe and go all the way up to here... I should go take these off shouldn't I?
5635,Feel better?,"Yeah! Much! Listen uh, not that I'm y'know insecure about my manhood or anything y'know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now."
5636,"Yeah, I understand.",Yeah! Okay! Hey! Hi!
5637,Hi!,"Y'know, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?"
5638,I don't think so.,Oh! Maybe it's because I'm on television. I'm an actor on Days of Our Lives.
5639,Wow!,Yeah.
5640,Really?!,Hm-mmm.
5641,$4.50 please.,"Oh, let me get this. These are for you."
5642,Ah. Joey you're-you're having lunch with my mom?,"No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure!"
5643,I had to go with the odds Rach.,Hey! You guys! Remember that audition I had a while ago and didn't get the part?
5644,The commercial?,No!
5645,That play?,No!
5646,That other play?,Nooo!
5647,The movie?,Yes!!
5648,Ohh!,Yes that's the one about the soldiers who fight in World War I!
5649,"Oh, yeah! Back then y'know, we called the Great War. It really was!","Well anyway, the guy they wanted backed out and now they want me! I start shooting today!"
5650,Wait! Wait! Wait! You can't start today! Today's the rehearsal dinner!,"Oh no, I'll be done by then."
5651,Oh. Well then way to go you big movie star!,"I know! All right, I'll see you guys over there! I'm off to fight the Nazis."
5652,"Oh, wait Joey! We fought the Nazis in World War II, not World War I.","Whoa! Okay. Yeah well, who-who was in World War I?"
5653,Hey Joey! We're ready.,Yeah! Me too.
5654,Richard? We're ready for you. Joey Tribbiani? This is Richard Crosby he's playing Vincent.,I'm doing my scenes with you?
5655,Nice to meet you Joey.,Wow! I can't believe this! This is incredible. I mean you just won an Oscar!

5661,"Hang on a minute! Joey, you keep touching your face. Is something wrong?","No. Nope, I uh...I th-I thought it might be kind of a cool character thing. Y'know? He's uh, he's a face toucher."
5662,,Hey! Where have you been?
5663,"Oh, taking my parents back to the hotel.",Oh.
5664,What? Are you going back to work?,Yeah.
5665,Nice shades.,"Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I won't get spit in the eyes, y'know?"
5666,"And if I remember correctly, Ray Ban was the official sponsor of World War I!",Great! All right. I'll see you later.
5667,"Hey, where's Chandler?","Uh, I think he's in Rachel's room. See ya."
5668,"Hey Joey, could you uh, go through these lines with me?",Oh man! They-they just redid my make-up!
5669,Just the last two pages.,All right.
5670,,Picture? What picture?
5671,"Could you uh, could you lower your script? I need to see your face so I can uh, play off your reaction.","Okay uh, look I know you're a great actor, okay? And you play all those Shakespeare guys and stuff..."
5672,"Oh, thanks.",But you're spittin' all over me man!
5673,Well of course I am!,You know you've been spitting on me?!
5674,"That's what real actors do! Annunciation is the mark of a good actor! And when you enunciate, you spit!",Wow! Didn't know that.
5675,Great!,Thanks! Okay-okay check it out! Picture? What picture? Eh?
5676,I found the picture!,What picture?!
5677,The picture of my wife! In your pack!,You went through my personal property?

5682,You are now.,No! No! I can't! You gotta get me out of it! I've got plans! Important plans!
5683,,"Excuse me, Aaron? Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn't supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating so I really can't work past four."
5684,"Joey, you gotta stay until the end. We can't stop filming just for you. It's not like it's your wedding.",I'm having surgery!
5685,What?!,"Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn't want you to worry about me. But, I'm having surgery today."
5686,What kind of surgery?!,Transplant.
5687,But you're supposed to work on Monday.,Hair transplant.
5688,But you're not bald.,It's not on my head.
5689,"Look Joey, there's nothing I can do. Besides, you're probably gonna be out by four anyway. We've just got one short scene. It's just you and Richard, and God knows he's a pro. You'll be fine. Morning Richard.","Hey! You're here! Great! Great! Great! Let's get going buddy, we've got a scene to shoot!"
5690,I'm wearing two belts.,Are you drunk?
5691,No!,Yes you are!
5692,,I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
5693,Let's reset.,What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!
5694,Are you a little off today? It's going terribly slowly.,"Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And I'm the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?"
5695,Of course! I'm-I'm sorry. I-I'd hate you to miss anything like that on account of me. I can do this!,Thank you. Thank you.
5696,"Still rolling, annnnd action!",I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
5697,Hello?,Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
5698,"Yeah, we got him back. Everything's fine.",Damnit!
5699,What? Why? Where are you?,I'm still on the set!
5700,Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!,"I know! I'm sorry! The guy's drunk, they won't let me go until we get this."
5701,Oh my God! I'm gonna have to find another minister.,"No! No, I'm the minister! All right, look-look, put 'em both on the phone, I'll marry them right now."
5702,"Ugh! Joey, I have to go.",Hey! Don't you hang up on me! I'll marry you and me right now! I have the power!
5703,,Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guy's hammered!
5704,You wouldn't happen to have a very big fork?,"So I uh, I just talked to the director. That's it, we're done for the day."
5705,Well have we finished the scene?,Yeah! You...you were wonderful.
5706,As were you.,"So I got your car, it's right outside."
5707,Why? Are we done for the day?,That's what you told me.
5708,"Oh, thank you. You're welcome.",No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on! Here we go.
5709,Let us begin. Dearly beloved...,"That's my line! I can take it from here, thanks. Dearly beloved, I'm sorry I'm a little late. You may be confused by this now, but you won't be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let's get started before the groom takes off again. Huh? We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I've known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as I've left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?"
5710,"Chandler, for so long I...I wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead, I found everything that I'd ever been looking for my whole life. And now...here we are...with our future before us...and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don't want to. You go!",Chandler?
5711,"No, that's okay. Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way it's okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I'm sure?","You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?"
5712,I do.,Yeah you do!
5713,Rings?,Aw crap! Okay-uh...uh let's-let's do the rings.
5714,,"We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. Now kiss her again."
5715,"Okay, I know I'm not supposed to know, but I do. And I'm so excited for you!",What? What's going on?
5716,Monica's pregnant!,Oh my God! Is that why you guys had to get married?!
5717,Guys! I'm not pregnant.,Ah. Slow swimmers?
5718,"Oh, about that. Joey, you have to change before the party.",I can't! I-I don't have any other clothes here.
5719,Oh sweet Lord.,"I'm sorry! Okay? I went down to the gift shop and it's either this or a bathrobe! Look, what's more important, the way I'm dressed or me being with you on your special day?"
5720,,"That's better, now just bend your arms a little more. There you go. Okay, look straight ahead. Now this time I want you to really put your ass into it."
5721,"Oh yes, Dennis is directing a new Broadway show.","I don't believe we've met, Joey Tribbiani."
5722,Dennis Phillips,"Wow, I've admired your work for years. You-you've done some really amazing stuff."
5723,"Oh, thank you. Well if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go get myself a drink. Be back in a moment.",Wow Dennis Phillips! That's great! How did you guys meet?
5724,,"Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? 'Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I would've done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and that's just for ugly people."
5725,What size shoes do you wear?,"Uh, eleven, eleven and a half."
5726,"Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?","Uh, I don't even really know where I left those. Sorry."
5727,Those aren't eleven and a half.,"Okay fine! I'm a seven! All right, I have surprisingly small feet. But the rest of me is good, I'll show ya!"
5728,And the world will never know.,Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?
5729,"Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives.",No-no! No! No! You don't tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks I'm a soap actor.
5730,But you're not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.,Hey!
5731,,"""I'd like to propose a toast. To Monica and Chandler, the greatest couple in the world. And my best friends. Now, my when I first found out they were getting married I was, I was a little angry. I was like, """"Why God? Why? How can you take them away from me?!"""" But then I thought back over all our memories together, some happy memories. And-and there was some sad memories. I'm sorry. And-and some scared memories-Whoa! Eh? And then, and then I realized I'll always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity. Oh! To the happy couple!"""
5732,,"So did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there?"
5733,"Oh my God, that was for my benefit?","Well, I'd like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I know you're casting for this new show..."
5734,"Look umm Joey, I-I don't think you're quite right for this project.","Oh, see that's where you're wrong. Whatever it is I can do it. And if didn't see it up there, just-just try me."
5735,It's an all Chinese cast. Can you be Chinese?,"Well I'm not proud of this, but..."
5736,I just didn't see the fast song coming.,"Shh. Shh. Don't try to talk, we'll get you up to your room, we'll soak your feet, you'll be okay."
5737,That is so sweet!,Yeah.
5738,"No, I mean it. There are so few genuinely nice guys out there.","Tell me about it, I feel like I'm holding down the fort all by myself."
5739,It's Joey right?,Yeah.
5740,"Listen y'know what sir? For the last time, I don't care what the computer says, we did not take a bag of Mashuga nuts from the mini-bar and we did not watch Dr. Do-Me-A-Little!",Hey!
5741,"Oh! Joey uh, were you in our room last night?",No. I was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill!
5742,What? What did you take a picture of?,Nothing! It was something.
5743,"Oh thanks. Champagne, strawberries...Oh my God! I can't believe Chandler ordered porn on our wedding night!","Yeah, that's sad. Mashuga nut?"
5744,I don't. He got...he-he-he-he's hit by a bus.,Hey!
5745,"Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?",Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she have an accent? I gotta make a call! I shoulda never walked into that Sunglass Hut!
5746,"Oh Joey! Joey! No, it's not you! You didn't get anybody pregnant!",Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on? Is somebody pregnant?
5747,Oh yeah. That's me.,Oh my God Pheebs! You're gonna have a baby?
5748,"Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God, I'm gonna have a baby!","Whoa, wait a minute. Who's the father?"
5749,You don't know him. It's not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby.,Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? 'Cause I will track him down and kick his ass!
5750,David Lynn.,David Lynn! David Lynn! David Lynn!!
5751,,Ooh-ooh-ooh! Are we opening presents?
5752,"No! No! I shouldn't have even opened these! I mean I-Joey I am out of control!! Joey, you have to do me a favor. No matter what I say, no matter what I do, please do not let me open another present! Okay?",Okay.
5753,Give me one more.,Okay.
5754,Hey.,"Oh good, uh you're here. Uh Pheebs? Listen uh sit down. I-I got something I want to say."
5755,All right.,"Umm, now uh... It's a scary world out there, especially for a single mom. Y'know, now I always thought you and I had a special bond so... Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?"
5756,Phoebe!,Why?! Why can't she marry me?!
5757,She's not pregnant. It's Rachel. Rachel's the one who's pregnant.,Oh my God.
5758,It's Joey!,Now I can't believe it! What? Rachel's pregnant? Who's the father?
5759,We don't know.,Ohh... I wonder if that dude.
5760,There's a dude?,Yeah.
5761,Who? Who is it?,"About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didn't see who it was but..."
5762,,The guy left this.
5763,I don't know how any of these got opened?!,You opened them all?
5764,"I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again!",Oh hey! You got my parent's gift!
5765,Yeah. What is that?,"Well, I don't know. I think it does something to salami."
5766,Hey! How'd it go?,Yeah. What-what did Tag say?
5767,Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?,"I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you."
5768,"No, I will. I'm just not up for it tonight.","Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know you're not gonna be alone in this."
5769,I'm not?,"Listen I uh... It's a scary world out there especially if you're a single mom. Y'know, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond. Y'know? So, Rachel Green will you marry me?"
5770,What?!!,"Pheebs, give me the ring back!"
5771,"No! Joey, oh you're so sweet. You're so-so sweet, honey. But I'm not, I'm not looking for a husband.",I understand.
5772,I can't say that didn't hurt. But I'll take you back Joey Tribbiani.,"Uh yeah. Pheebs, listen about that. I only offered..."
5773,Ooh! A Salami Buddy!,There you go!
5774,Oh my God!!,Oh my God!
5775,That's right. Get it out of your system while we're alone.,Hey!
5776,,We know its Ross!
5777,Me too!,I'm gonna be an uncle! Come here!
5778,Well I was gonna tell him that I'm-I'm gonna have the baby and he can be as involved as he wants.,"Well that, that sounds good."
5779,"Yeah, bye.",Bye.
5780,What?! I am an excellent secret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets.,What secrets?
5781,,You'll tell me later?
5782,"Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.","Y'know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something."
5783,All in good time my love. All in good time. Oh shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment. Well you can let me in later.,"I don't have a key, they took mine to give to you."
5784,What?! They took mine to give to you!,Why would they take away our keys?
5785,Maybe they don't trust us.,No that's not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town.
5786,You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with Monica's guest towels?,"Hey, I washed those!"
5787,No you didn't.,Yeah that didn't sound like me.
5788,"Well, what am I gonna do? I really need my guitar!","Yeah, I have stuff in there too."
5789,What stuff?,"Monica's chicken parm! I'll take care of it. Hey Mr. Treeger, it's Joey Tribbiani. Listen, I need to get into Monica and Chandler's apartment. It's an emergency. Uhh, gas leak! Yeah oh, and bring garlic bread."
5790,"Well, she really wanted to talk to you now.","Yeah, it seemed pretty important."
5791,,Really?
5792,"Well, we-we said we'd just do it that one time but, but now I think she may wanna start things up again.","Yeah, I don't think that's what it is."
5793,Why? What-what else could it be?,"Oh wow, I don't feel well."
5794,Maybe it's something you ate?,"Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel."
5795,,I still can't believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.
5796,,What the hell is that?
5797,,"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?"
5798,I've looked everywhere. There's no gas leak.,Huh. So then I can heat this up?
5799,Oh my God! What happened to the door?!,So it's noticeable huh?
5800,"Yeah but uh... Okay, okay look you guys know that Rachel and I slept together, but there's something else. Rachel's pregnant.",Oh my God!!! I can't believe that!!
5801,A little bit.,How are you doing?
5802,Okay. Okay. I mean I'll be okay. It's just I don't think I handled it very well.,"Well, what did you say to her?"
5803,"But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97% effective.",What?
5804,I gotta go find her.,Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they don't even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box!
5805,Evidently they do.,What?!
5806,,"Hey Monica it's Joey. Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin' from your apartment."
5807,What else is new?,"Yeah and we'd go check it out, but you took away our keys."
5808,Well do something! Get in there!,How? I guess I could break down your door.
5809,Yeah! Do that!,And-and you won't blame us for any damage?
5810,No! Are you doing it?! I don't hear anything! Come on!,"Uh, okay I'll-I'll-I'll break it down."
5811,Hi.,Hey!
5812,Oh.,I don't see the baby. Where is it?
5813,Hi!,Hey! You're back!
5814,I know.,"A couple? Like two people? Like one , two people?"
5815,"Listen, they are really great. If you just got a chance...",Y'know what? Why don't you just give us our souvenirs and get the hell out of here?
5816,We didn't get anything for anyone.,Hm-mm! Yeah nice necklace!
5817,"Well it happened about six weeks ago, and uh I had just got home from work and Ross was already there 'cause I guess he had been hanging out with Joey.",You're welcome buddy.
5818,"Yes let's. Y'know what? Uh, it's-it's not important. What is important is that, is that we're having a baby. And it's not-Doesn't matter who came on to who.",Whom. That's right.
5819,I can't believe he taped the two of them having sex!,Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.
5820,Let's call 'em.,Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!
5821,Hello? Eighth street deli?,"Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talkin' to that place."
5822,Hello? It's the deli again!,All right! I'll have a sandwich!
5823,What?! People don't do that!,Oh I think we do.
5824,"And you've never been funnier. Joke, joke, joke, you were a hoot!","Y'know what? Don't worry about it, you still got me and Phoebe."
5825,"Filming Rachel is not something I planned. Okay look, here's what happened, and Joey you-you can back me up on this. All right, about-about a month and a half ago I came to you with a problem? Umm, a personal thing.",Personal thing? What personal thing? I don't know.
5826,About...about sex? That I hadn't had sex in months?,Yeah I knew what you were talkin' about.
5827,Hey!,Hey.
5828,"Do you have a minute? I'd like to talk to you about something I'm, I'm really uncomfortable talking about.","Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom?"
5829,"I actually had a topic in mind! I'm, I'm kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise.","Whoa, for like months?"
5830,"Five to be lying, six.",Six months? Whoa that's rough.
5831,"Well, I mean it's not all bad. I'm learning to appreciate the uh, smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.",The sky's blue Ross and I had sex yesterday!
5832,"Please, help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go well okay-I'm scared for my health!","Okay. Okay. Umm...Ooh! Oh-oh, I got something. It's this story I came up with, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it; they're like putty."
5833,Really? Well then tell it to me.,"Okay. Now you're gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it, but you have to remember it is just the story."
5834,I'll try to control myself.,"Okay. Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western Europe..."
5835,You were backpacking across Western Europe?,Have a nice six more months Ross!
5836,"Okay! Okay! Okay. I'm sorry. Please, please, you were in Western Europe and?","I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. I was at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded. And there were tall trees all around. It was dead silent. Gorgeous. And across the lake I saw...a beautiful woman...bathing herself...but she was crying..."
5837,,Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go?
5838,Great! I'm across the street having sex with her right now. Your story sucks!,"Hey! Look, if it didn't work it's because you didn't tell it right! Show me how you did it."
5839,"No! No, I don't...don't want to.",How long since you've seen a girl naked?
5840,I was backpacking across Western Europe.,I'm not feeling it.
5841,"I was just outside Barcelona, hiking...",No! No! No Ross! I'm not hot! Are you hot?
5842,It's been six months! I'm always hot!,"Well you're not selling the story! It's like; it's like you don't believe it! Look, I gotta go. I got a date, but try this. Do what I do when I'm preparing for an audition. Okay? I'll set you up with my video camera and you can record yourself and-and see what you're doing wrong."
5843,I'll try that.,"All right now... All right, you're all set up. You're good to go. Just hit record. All right?"
5844,Thanks.,Good luck.
5845,Thanks. And-and hey Joe?,Yeah?
5846,"Listen, if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know I'll help you out.",That means a lot to me man.
5847,What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!,Y'know what? This is not fair to her. Let's just forget the tape!
5848,Thank you. No!,You're right.
5849,Joey! No!,Loud and clear!
5850,I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.,"Y'know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn't give you real names either."
5851,"Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don't give out fake names.","Oh yeah? Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you."
5852,Hey! Is Ross still here?,"Uh no Rach, he's gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake."
5853,"Clearly you don't want people to see this tape. Now I don't want people to see this tape either, but you so badly don't people to see it makes me want to see it. You see?",Are we watchin' the tape or not?!
5854,Hello! Can I get you anything?,I'm so happy!
5855,How do you know about that story?!,How do you know about that story?!
5856,I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy!,Some guy!!
5857,"No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams.",Ken Adams!!
5858,Cut! Very nice people!,"Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner."
5859,Well don't-What happened to Jessica's body?!,"I'm not telling, you'll have to see it on TV!"
5860,You don't know do you?,"No, couldn't care less."
5861,Hey good scene man.,Hey you too!
5862,,What? You weren't in it.
5863,Oh!,"Oh sorry. Uh-uh, Kash?"
5864,Yes?,"This is my friend Rachel. Rachel, Kash, Kash, Rachel."
5865,"Well, Joey probably thinks I'll just embarrass him. Y'know, he thinks I'm some kind of a soap opera nut-Which I'm not! I'm not. Although I do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan. And uh, and that your-your dog's name is Wally. Well look at that, I'm just stroking your arm.",Here we go! Here we go!
5866,,Hey!
5867,Hi!,"Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming."
5868,I thought I was a complete idiot.,"Hey, I'm with you. He even asked me if I thought you'd go out with him."
5869,"Oh! Oh, I think I'm gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?",I said no.
5870,What?!,What? I...I just figured since you're pregnant you're not gonna be seeing people.
5871,"Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?",I didn't tell him. I didn't know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.
5872,"Good-good, don't tell him. Don't tell him. Just have him call me okay?","Rach look, I really don't think that's such a great..."
5873,Hi!,Hey!
5874,"So, what do you want to do tonight? There's a Ukrainian film at the Angelica that's supposed to be very powerful. Interested?",No. No. But I'll go see a normal person movie with ya.
5875,"Why no, it's the opposite of weird. It's-it's uh, regular. It's-it's uh, it's mundane. It's actually uh, a little dull.",It's no Ukrainian film.
5876,A date?! She's-she's got a date?! With who?,I set her up with this actor on my show.
5877,You set her up?!,No
5878,Joey what-what were you thinking?!,"Well, I was thinking that it'd probably be okay because Ross hasn't gone out with Rachel in five years!"
5879,"Joey, I'm not worried about her! I'm worried about my baby! Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this actor taking them?",Hey! I'm an actor too! I'm not sure. I think they're taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island.
5880,A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?!,Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?
5881,Hey Joey.,"Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash."
5882,,So what movie do you want to see-And not another one I have to read. Okay? I get enough of that from books.
5883,Books?,"All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it's like enough!"
5884,"Well, I tell you what. Why don't we uh, why don't we just stay here? Let's not see a movie, we'll just hang.",And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?
5885,"Hey, if that's what you want to do I'm not gonna say no.",Dude! What is going on?!
5886,I just...I have to find out how it went.,Why?
5887,This guy could be my baby's stepfather!,They go on one date and you're worried about them getting married?! He's not you!
5888,I just-I-I can't believe she's-she's dating?!,"Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?"
5889,I don't know! I guess I just can't believe any of this is happening.,What do you mean?
5890,"It's just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan's, it's like-It breaks my heart a little. I mean I've always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y'know? Maybe fight over the science section.",That's a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!
5891,No! No I can't. I mean Rachel's out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.,"Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel?"
5892,It used to be. Now she doesn't really have a face. Smokin' body though.,"Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn't Rachel."
5893,No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?,"I know, but I don't think that's what she wants."
5894,"No, it's not what I want either. I mean I-I can't force myself to fall in love with her again now.","That's okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It's not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there's gonna be a brand new little baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like?"
5895,Yeah.,"Hey, I tell you what. Let's you and me go out and have some fun. Huh? Whatever you want. Come on!"
5896,We can still catch that Ukrainian film.,"No, I said fun!"
5897,Not two years in a row.,"Look, I'll come to the party but I'm not dressing up."
5898,You have to!,"No way! Look, Halloween is so stupid! Dressing up, pretending to be someone you're not..."
5899,"Yeah. Yeah, I think I will.",That hot girl from their wedding?
5900,Yeah.,"Well hey-hey if she needs any idea for costumes, she could be a bikini model, or a slutty nurse, or a sexy cheerleader huh-Ooh-ooh, Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre-No-no-no! Slutty Leatherface."
5901,No bunny at all!! Always no bunny at all!!!,Hey!
5902,You didn't dress up either?!,"Yes I did! I'm Chandler. Dude, what happened?"
5903,How is that me?,Okay. I'm Chandler
5904,When have I ever done that?!,When have I ever done that?!
5905,Wow! I don't have the worst costume anymore!,"Hey all right, Ross came as doody."
5906,Hey Joey?,Yeah.
5907,You read comic books right?,Exclusively.
5908,"Who do you think would win in a fight, Catwoman or Supergirl?","Catwoman, hands down."
5909,Yeah...,"But between you and Phoebe, I'd have to give the edge to Phoebe."
5910,What?! Really?!,"Are you kiddin'? Phoebe lived on the street. Okay? Plus, she's got this crazy temper. She-She's not standing right behind me is she?"
5911,"No you're fine. All right well, do you think I could take Rachel?",I'm not sure.
5912,What?! Come on I am tough! Punch me right here! As hard as you can!,Will you relax?! What are you taking this so seriously for? It doesn't matter.
5913,"Oh really? Okay? Well what would you say if I told you that, y'know, Ross or Chandler could beat you up?","""I would say, """"Woman, please!"""""""
5914,No I'm not! You are!,Here comes the temper.
5915,,"Okay, here's a good one for ya. Who do think would win in a fight between Ross and Chandler."
5916,I can't answer that! Chandler's my husband.,So Ross?
5917,"Oh relax man, relax. You're looking a little flushed.","Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our question."
5918,What question?,"Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?"
5919,There's no question.,So you think Ross too?
5920,"Wait-wait!! Okay, stop it! Stop it! Stop! Now listen, no one's gonna fight in this apartment.","Hey Monica! People came to see a fight, let's give 'em what they came for!"
5921,"Hey, you guys could arm wrestle.",Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse.
5922,Oh yeah? You're going further down! Downtown!,"Seriously guys, the trash talk is embarrassing."
5923,"Uh, I think I just did. And uh-oh, here it comes again. Shut up!",Rach?
5924,You too. And Ursula?! It was really nice meeting you tonight!!,"Pheebs come on! Bunny vs. Doody! We're waiting! Okay. Okay guys, one match, winner take all. Oh wait-wait! What does the winner get?"
5925,And dignity.,"Okay, if you say so. All right, ready? Set! Go!"
5926,Wow! They're both really strong.,Or equally weak.
5927,Yay! My hero!,You're a weird lady.
5928,,Hey!
5929,"Hey! Well, I had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying.",That's not so bad.
5930,"No, I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh, I am just awful with children!","Come on! You're good with kids. They're just crazy on Halloween. Y'know, they're all greedy and hopped up on sugar!"
5931,Really? You think that's all it is?,"Absolutely! Halloween is the worst. Except for Christmas...and their birthdays. Kinda get a little crazy during the summer too. And anytime they're hungry or sleepy. Y'know, kids are tough. Good luck with that."
5932,Ezel? Ezel? Ezel?,"Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?"
5933,Really?!,"No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler."
5934,Sweet!,"All right, well finish your coffee; let's go."
5935,Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.,"To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, you're not gonna be on TV!"
5936,"No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.","Oh, you're switching apartments?"
5937,"It's not for me, it's for Rachel.",But Rachel has an apartment.
5938,"Yeah, but when the baby comes she's gonna want to move.",She is?
5939,"Yeah, you didn't expect her to live there with a baby did you?",I guess I didn't really think about it.
5940,Hey!,Hey!
5941,How was the game?,"Oh, okay. I...I ate way too much."
5942,Oh.,"Ooh. So umm, I was talkin' to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place."
5943,Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just let go.,I was kinda hoping you'd stay.
5944,"Oh but Joey, I have to go. There's no room for a baby here.","No room? It's a baby. It's like this big. Y'know, I mean you-you could you could put it over here. Or-or-or we could put it right here. Aw, it's cute, right? Or-or we could put it over here. You wouldn't even notice it. Where's the baby?"
5945,"Honey, it's not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby changes everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when there's a screaming baby around.",I could use a challenge! It's getting pretty easy.
5946,"Honey, it's so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I can't do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.",I love living with you so much. I just wish things didn't have to change.
5947,I know.,Y'know I blame Ross for this.
5948,I do too a little bit.,"I'm gonna miss you, you're the hottest roommate I ever had."
5949,What is this?,"Hey! Uh, this is just to give you an idea. Okay well, we can put screens here, so that the baby has privacy, and-and-and maybe a mobile over the crib. And uh-Oh look! Here's a baby monitor , which until the baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies. Huh?"
5950,You're so sweet. Oh my God! And you gave the baby Hugsy!,Ahhhhhhhhhhhh.... That-that-that's really just to show where the baby would go. Y'know why don't I hold on to him so that there's no confusion?
5951,"But Joey the baby is going to be crying, it's going to be loud.",I'm loud!
5952,It's gonna be up all night!,I'm up all night!
5953,It's gonna poop!,Hello!
5954,What about all the women you want to bring home?,"Look, if I'm bringing home a woman who can't stand being around a baby, then maybe I don't want to be with that woman! Or maybe we'll just do it in the bathroom of the club!"
5955,"Joey, are you sure?","Yeah! All right-Look, I know sometimes it'll be hard, okay? But, it'll also be really...really great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay."
5956,I want me to stay too.,Ohh!
5957,Thank you. Oh Joey and look at this crib! It's so cute!,I know! I found it on the street.
5958,Are you serious-Really?! It's in such good condition.,Yeah.
5959,Wow! Whoa-whoa what's under the covers?,I don't know.
5960,It's moving.,Ew.
5961,It's still--It's got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!!,Ooh! Ah! Okay!
5962,Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think I'm gonna stay here.,Isn't that great?
5963,"I thought we weren't gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! Y'know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.",It's a grand tradition!
5964,Well you could've untied it with your hands.,"This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasn't allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!"
5965,You went home with the waitress.,"Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night."
5966,My God! You must be good in bed!,"So uh, you and Mona, been a while now. How's it going?"
5967,"Ah, it's good. It's going good. I mean, we get along great. She's, she's so...",Hot?
5968,"Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that you're going down the same path, but you're really going down different ones.",I'm gonna take that book and beat you to death with it.
5969,Honey! That's crazy! I don't want you to get me a stripper...,Will you let the lady talk?!
5970,All right fine! But I'm only doing this for you!,Yeah!
5971,I Understand who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?,I'm sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby...
5972,,"So you uh, nervous about getting married?"
5973,What are you doing?,"Look, look let's pretend it's a real bachelor party. Okay? Y'know? Before your wedding. Come on, it'll be fun."
5974,Okay. I can't believe tomorrow's the big day.,How does it feel knowing you're never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing you're gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.
5975,,"That's her! Okay, come on!"
5976,So which one of you lucky boys is Chandler?,"Uh, that-that's-that's me!"
5977,That's me.,"Joey Tribbiani, a big fan."
5978,That was weird.,Why-why would she go in the bedroom?
5979,So she's a...,"Yeah, that's one naked hooker!"
5980,I can't believe there is a naked hooker in there!,"Wait! Wait! Maybe she's a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what she's supposed to do."
5981,"Uh, no. But I could pretend to strip, but that's gonna cost extra. Okay, here's the extras, handcuffs, spanking...","Maybe Monica's playing a joke on ya. Y'know? Getting her own husband a hooker, that's pretty funny."
5982,"That is funny, maybe for my birthday she'll murder someone.",I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.
5983,Hey! I did not dump Rachel! Nor are we still together. Can I just... Why don't we just let the machine get that?,Hey Ross. It's Joey. There's a hooker over here and we thought maybe you'd know something about it.
5984,,Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.
5985,Why would she do that?,"Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything you're really bad at y'know, sexually?"
5986,What's taking you boys so long?,In a minute!
5987,In a minute? What's gonna happen in a minute?!,"All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave."
5988,Why me?!,Hey! It's your bachelor party.
5989,Which is why you should do it.,I don't want to. You do it!
5990,You do it!,You do it!
5991,"All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave! What?",I miss this.
5992,I don't think we've actually done this before!,"No, I-I miss hanging out with you."
5993,Well we...we still hang out.,Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable. Y'know now it's like...things are different.
5994,"Well y'know, things are different. I'm...I'm married now.","Oh sure-And hey, don't get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys. I just...I miss...hanging out...just-just us, y'know?"
5995,"Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on we'll make time to hang out with each other.",You got it. Come here.
5996,...there's gonna be a wedding! That's unacceptable Rachel! What the hell does love have to do with it anyway?! There are more important things in a marriage other than love! ...constantly thinking about things! You have to think about the consequences of your decision.,Hey! I do too think about the consequences of my decisions! What gives you the right to... Go to hell! Stupid guy on my phone.
5997,,"Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back."
5998,Oh my...God! Let me see that!,You fall for it every time!
5999,"Oh, and by the way, he's lost a bunch of weight. I mean he looks goo-ood! Okay, I mean really, really gorgeous! I still love Chandler.",I just want you to say it once in a while.
6000,"All right okay, just so you know, I'm not gonna make a turkey this year.",What?!
6001,Well Phoebe doesn't eat turkey...,Phoebe!
6002,"Turkey's are beautiful, intelligent animals!",No they're not! They're ugly and stupid and delicious!
6003,"All right! Okay, it's just Phoebe. Will's still on a diet, Chandler doesn't eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachel's having her aversion to poultry.",She is?
6004,Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?,Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.
6005,"Anyway, it just doesn't seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It's a lot of work.","But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!"
6006,All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just-there's gonna be a ton left over.,No there won't! I promise I will finish that turkey!
6007,"All right, you're telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?","That's right! 'Cause I'm a Tribbiani! And this is what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we don't read a lot or run very fast, but damnit! We can eat!"
6008,"Hey, what are you doing? You gotta save room, you've got almost an entire turkey to eat.",Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomach first. Eatin' chips is like stretching.
6009,All right.,"Don't worry, Tribbianis never get full."
6010,"I actually know what you're talking about. I'm here to tell you something my friend, you can eat and eat and eat but nothing will ever fill that void.",Who the hell is this guy?
6011,Will! From high school.,Oh hey!
6012,,That's it?! Even if nobody helps me I can eat that no problem. At least give me a challenge!
6013,This is Chandler's chicken. This is the turkey.,Oh. How-how big is that?
6014,About nineteen pounds.,It's like me when I was born.
6015,"I said it was typical. Typical of you, Rachel Green, Queen Rachel does whatever she wants in little Rachel land.","Seriously, who is this guy?"
6016,Joey stop staring! There's nothing there! It's not true!,I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.
6017,,You are my Everest.
6018,"Joey, you don't have to finish that.","Oh yes I do. Otherwise what's next? Today I'm just a guy who can't finish a turkey, but tomorrow I'm the guy who eats half a Powerbar, wraps up the rest, and puts in the fridge? No! No, I just...I just-I gotta change my pants. Jeans have no give."
6019,Okay. It's exactly how I'd imagined it would be.,All right where's that turkey!
6020,Joey! Those are my maternity pants!,Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!
6021,,Well that's it. I'm done. Whew! There come the meat sweats.
6022,Is there anything we can do for you?,"No just, nobody press on my stomach."
6023,,Whoa-hey-wh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?
6024,"Yeah, you want some?","Ah, just cut me a little sliver. A little bigger. Little bigger. What?! Are you afraid you're gonna run out?! Cut me a real piece!"
6025,Bye.,"Oh hey Rach, listen-Hi!"
6026,Hi.,"Umm, can you do me a favor? I was talkin' to my sister and she knows you work at Ralph Lauren..."
6027,"No, forget it! No way! I am not sending anymore Ralph Lauren clothes to prison. It is a waste.","No-no-no-no-no-no, not her, not her. My youngest sister, Dina, she's really interested in fashion, and she wants to talk to someone successful, y'know, to give her some advice."
6028,I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors...,"Oh no-no-no-no, she wants to talk to you!"
6029,Really?! Oh my God! I'm successful!,"Okay, so will you meet with her?"
6030,Yes! I'd love to! Have her come by the office.,"Great! Thanks! You're gonna love her so much. And-Oh, she's the smartest of all the Tribbiani children. Hey, y'know the S.A.T's?"
6031,Yeah.,She took 'em!
6032,,Here she is! Future fashion superstar!
6033,"Oh Joey, I'm hardly a...",My little sister Dina!
6034,Thanks so much for meetin' with me. Joey's told me so much about you!,"This is so exciting for her. Well, I'll let you two fash...ists get down to business."
6035,,Hey! It's my fashion girls! What's wrong?
6036,"Honey, why don't you sit down? Dina has something that she wants to tell you.","Oh. What's, what's going on? Is it mom? Is she sick? Is it dad's heart? Is that a sandwich?"
6037,"Joe, mom and dad are fine...",Is that a sandwich?!
6038,I'm pregnant.,What?!
6039,Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich!,Well obviously this is a mistake! You can't be pregnant! Because you have to have sex to get pregnant!
6040,What?! Dina...,Bub!!! I can't believe this! You're the good one! You went to college! Both years! Who did this to you?!
6041,"Bobby Corso, but he's a real nice guy. I like him a lot. He's real funny.","You got pregnant for funny?! Dina...if he's funny...laugh! All right, I'll be back in a little while! You stay here!"
6042,Why? Where are you going?,I can't look at you right now!
6043,"Joey, what are you doing?","Just what needs to be done! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman..."
6044,Oh Joey this is crazy!,"Don't interrupt me when I'm talkin' to God! Now where were we? Oh right, okay. Do you Dina, take this man..."
6045,No!,Oh you'll take 'em!
6046,No I won't!,Hey! You don't get a say in this!
6047,Yes I do!,"""Ahhh! I heard """"I do"""", we're halfway there! Okay! You!"""
6048,"Yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it.",Well what am I supposed to do?
6049,You're supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can make their own decisions.,No they can't! They were stupid enough to get knocked up!
6050,"Joey, just because they're not getting married doesn't mean this is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!","Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Let's hear their plan! Now, what's the future look like for Dina and Bobby?"
6051,Well...I really have high hopes for my band.,You were right. He is funny.
6052,Really?,"Dina, if you're having a baby you should be married! Even if it is to Bobby! Dude, that's not a compliment!"
6053,No Joey! I knew you wouldn't be supportive!,So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you gonna do? You're gonna have the baby and-and raise it by yourself...without a husband?! You can't be a single mother alone! You're gonna ruin your life!
6054,Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?,No! No! No! It's different for you. You're so strong and together. You're not some dumb kid who doesn't know what she's doing.
6055,Excuse me?,"One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay."
6056,So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?,"Maybe! Well! Well...so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb Nuts-Oh forget it! I can't!"
6057,"Look, Rachel's told me how much easier you've made all this on her. Why can't you do that for me?",Because! 'Cause... 'Cause you're my baby sister!
6058,"And you're my big brother! I mean, you're my favorite guy in the whole world. I'm not even scared to tell mom and dad. I was scared of telling you.","Well I'd be scared of them, but all right."
6059,"Joey, I can't stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me. I want him to have his uncle. Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?",Of course he's gonna have his Uncle Joey!
6060,"We're gonna be all right. I mean, even if we're not married this baby is gonna be so loved. Not just by us.",That's right! By his uncle too!
6061,"Okay Bobby, why don't we just come over here and let them have a little moment.",Come here!
6062,"Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?","Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now."
6063,"Oh yeah, probably at the end. Oh my God! He only took pictures of my breasts!",I'm missin' picture time?!
6064,,Congratulations! You just got married!
6065,"Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!","Hey-hey-hey, hey that's your wife you're talking about!"
6066,"Yes. Hi, I'd like to order a pizza. Okay, can I ask you a question? Is-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? Very Ambercrombie & Fitch. I'll call you back.",Who was that?
6067,It's just the pizza place.,You hung up on the pizza place? I don't hang up on your friends.
6068,"I'm sorry honey, I'm just having a, having a rough day.","Oh, what's wrong?"
6069,"Oh you really, you really just don't want to hear about it.",Then why did I ask?
6070,"Okay, it's just-and this is really embarrassing-but lately with this whole pregnancy thing I'm just finding myself...how do I put this umm, erotically charged.",Is that college talk for horny?
6071,"Yeah. So y'know, I have all of these feelings and I don't know what to do about them, because I can't date like a normal person, which is fine because I don't need a relationship, I mean all I really want is one great night. Just sex, y'know? No strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that I feel comfortable with and who knows what he's doing. For just one great night, I mean is that really so...hard...to find. So how was your day?","Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon."
6072,"Well, I gotta get up early and it's almost seven o'clock.","Yeah, I gotta, I gotta go to my room too."
6073,"Okay, good night!",Good night.
6074,,I can't do it!
6075,I didn't ask you to do it!,You're Rachel!
6076,You're Joey!,You're my friend!
6077,Right back at ya!,"But plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad."
6078,And so bad. I don't even know what you're talking about because I didn't ask you to do anything!,I know!
6079,,Do you wanna do it?
6080,No!,"All right, me neither! I was just testing you!"
6081,That's the end of this conversation!,This conversation never happened!
6082,Never happened! Good night!,Good night!
6083,,Get back in there!
6084,"Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you guys are here. I've been dying to tell someone what happened in the Paleontology department today.",Do you think he saw us or can we still sneak out?
6085,"No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes! Why didn't I get head of the department?","Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm..."
6086,Yeah.,"I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?"
6087,"Uh, Paul's Caf. They got great food and it's really romantic.","Ooh, great! Thanks!"
6088,"Yeah! Oh, and then afterwards you can take her to the Four Seasons for drinks. Or you go downtown and listen to some jazz. Or dancing-Oh! Take her dancing!","You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, I'll tell ya..."
6089,"Ooh, I miss dating. Gettin' all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant. I'm not gonna be able to do that for so long, and it's so much fun! I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.","Hey, y'know what?"
6090,Huh?,Why don't I take you out?
6091,"What?! Joey, you don't want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.","Yes I do! And we're gonna go out, we're gonna have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out..."
6092,Okay! I'll go with ya! I'll go! I'll go with ya.,I'll be fun.
6093,Joey? Could you get that? What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?,"No, I'm picking you up for our date. These are for you."
6094,"Ohh, Lilies. Joey, they're my favorite. Thank you.","And, a brownie! Well, half a brownie. Actually, it's just bag. It's been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin' to feel faint so..."
6095,"Oh man! This is so great! I actually feel like I'm going on a real date! Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and I'm wearing underwear that goes up to about......there.","Hey come on now, this is a real date. Uh, so...nice place you got here. Foosball, huh? Pizza box. Oh, a subscription to Playboy, my kind of woman."
6096,"Yeah, actually that's my roommate's.",I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.
6097,"Ah yes, but he's very protective of me so you'd better watch yourself.","Ah... Hey, so this roommate of yours...is he good looking?"
6098,Hm-mmm.,"Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?"
6099,"Yeah, but I'm pretty sure he's gay.","No-no-no-no, he's not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!"
6100,"Emmm. Now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway I can substitute the three-pound lobster?","Y'know what? Bring her both, and I'll have the same."
6101,"Wow! This is shaping up to be a pretty good date-Oh, I almost forgot. I didn't pay you the rent check.","Oh whoa-whoa-whoa, no roommate stuff. Okay? We're on a date."
6102,Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So do you have any moves?,"No! No. Umm, just myself and if they don't like me for- I'm sorry I couldn't even get through that."
6103,I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.,"Oh alright. Umm, well, okay, I usually start by having a bottle of wine sent to my table from a fan."
6104,Oh my God. And that works?!,"""Well it does when you combine it with, """"This is so embarrassing, I just want to have a normal life!"""""""
6105,"Oh, you poor little famous man.","Oh okay, how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you, but you're so beautiful...I don't think I can."
6106,"Oh my God! Wow! That was fantastic, I almost leaned in. I really almost did!","Alright, so...so tell me one of your moves."
6107,Alright. So where'd you grow up?,"That's your move? Boy Rach, you're lucky you're hot."
6108,"Come on, just answer the question!",Queens.
6109,And so were-were you close to your parents?,"Yeah, with my mom. Yeah, not so much with my dad."
6110,Why not?,"I don't know. I guess there's just always been this distance y'know-I mean we both try to pretend it's not there, but it is."
6111,Oh. It's gotta be rough.,"Yeah, it is. It's really tough. Y'know sometimes I think-Wow!! Nice move!"
6112,Huh?,"""""""Where'd you grow up,"""" it's so simple!"""
6113,"Thank you! And now if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the rest room.",Yeah.
6114,And now you're watching me walk away.,Yes I am! Again so simple!
6115,I am not gonna answer that!,"Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?"
6116,"No one! They are my friends, I wouldn't punch any of them.",Chandler?
6117,"Yeah, but I don't know why. Look at me, I'm having such a wonderful time!","Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!"
6118,I know!,I never laughed so hard-Did you see the wine come out of my nose?
6119,"Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.","I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so much."
6120,Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.,Huh. Huh.
6121,"All right, now don't judge me. I normally wait until my date leaves, but you live here. I'm ripping into this swan.","Ah! Okay, well then you don't judge me. I'm gonna suck on the cellophane from the brownie I had before."
6122,"So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani's end of the night moves?","Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips look irresistible."
6123,How do you do that?,"Now you can't tell anyone, but uh...I put on shiny lip balm."
6124,Oh my God!,"Yeah, like a moth to a flame, I'm telling ya. Okay all right, so now you go."
6125,"No, I don't want to tell you.",Why not?
6126,Because it's embarrassing.,"More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?! I didn't say raspberry before did I? All right just-just tell me Rach, just tell me!"
6127,"""Okay. All right, stand up. Well, when we're at the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a second, and then I make this sound, """"Hmmm."""" Okay, I know it doesn't sound like anything, but I swear it works.""","Yeah. Why-Yeah, that would work for ya..."
6128,"All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time.",Oh. Yeah. Me to.
6129,"Besides, I-I think I figured out a much faster route, I'm sure I can make it this time. I just...I just can't be afraid to get a little bit...hit by cars.",Hey!
6130,"Hi! Hey, remember how last night we were talking about that movie Cujo?","Oh yeah, I still can't believe you haven't seen Cujo. What is wrong with you?"
6131,Relax! It's not like it's Citizen Kane!,Have you ever tried to sit through Citizen Kane?
6132,"Yeah I know it's really boring, but it's like a big deal. Anyway, I was thinking about renting Cujo sometime.","Oh yeah? All right, let's do it tonight."
6133,Well don't you have that big date tonight?,Oh right!
6134,"Hey Joey, can I ask you something?",Yeah.
6135,"After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?","Oh my God! You did too? It totally freaked me out, what was that?!"
6136,I don't know! I'm-I'm kinda thinking it-it was the lobster...,"Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster."
6137,"Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.","Yeah me too, all night."
6138,Really?! How come we didn't cross paths?,"Yeah well that's because uh...I stayed in my room. Yeah, you don't want to look in my hamper."
6139,Hey. Are you all right? You seem a little distracted.,"No-no! I'm fine. It's just... Hey, can I ask you something? Have you ever looked at someone that you've known for a while and then suddenly...suddenly see them a different way?"
6140,You mean like from behind?,"Yeah. Yeah, that...that's exactly it. You're right. Yeah."
6141,"Ew, y'know what? One time I saw this guy from behind and he seemed like a totally normal guy and then he turned around and it was Stephan Baldwin!","Ooh! Yeah. So yeah, so you know exactly what I'm talking about."
6142,Totally! Wow! Would you excuse me for a sec?,"Oh yeah, sure. Ehhh."
6143,Oh God! Thank God you're home! I'm watching Cujo.,Alone?!
6144,Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!,"Hey, did you get to the part where they're trapped in the car and Cujo's throwin' himself at the windshield?"
6145,"No! No! Seriously, what's wrong with the dog?! Wait a minute, what are you doing home so early? What happened to your date?","Oh uh, it didn't work out."
6146,Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?,"Oh uh, okay. Yeah."
6147,"Y'know, I never thought I'd say this about a movie, but I really hope this dog dies. What are you doing over there? Come sit here, you protect me.","Oh sure, yeah, why not?"
6148,"Okay. Okay, that's him! That's him! That's Cujo! That's Cujo!","All right, I know! I know. Yeah, it'll be okay."
6149,"Oh my God....What's he gonna do now? I can't watch! Oh. Seriously, how can you watch this? Aren't you scared?",Terrified.
6150,,"All right. It's a new day. All that stuff about Rachel, you don't feel that now. It was crazy! You're fine. You're better than fine! You are, as your friend Tony would say, Grrrreat! Everything's normal! She's just your friend Rachel! Your friend Rachel. Your friend! Rachel."
6151,"Hi, sweetie.","Hey, it's your girlfriend, Rachel!"
6152,"Honey, it's 2:00 on a Wednesday and I'm watching Road Rules, how stressed do you think I am?","Hey, Chandler, you got a minute? I-I really need to talk to you."
6153,"Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?","Well, neither."
6154,"Oh my God, what's up?!","I don't know. It's-it's just...lately, I've been feeling... Okay, here's what it is... You know what? I feel a lot better, thanks!"
6155,"Oh no-no, no you don't, just come back.","All right. Okay. You and Monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to London. Oh, no, but that's different. I mean, there are rules there, too! You know what I mean?"
6156,Do you?,"It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the same place, right?"
6157,In London?,Yeah.
6158,"Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.","You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me."
6159,Hey.,"Hey. Well, what's up?"
6160,"Umm, Joey, I know.",What?
6161,I knooow.,Whaaat?
6162,I know about your feelings.,Oh my God. You do?
6163,"Yes, and I'm sorry. I-I know things worked out for Chandler and Monica, but that's very rare.","I know. I know. And this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys. I mean, it's Rachel for God sakes."
6164,"For God sakes, it's Rachel!",I know. I know. And she's not only my friend; she's my pregnant friend! She's my pregnant friend who's Ross' ex!
6165,Yeah that's Rachel. Beat me over the head with it.,"What am I going to do? You know, and I keep, I keep trying to get rid of these feelings, y'know? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything I don't like about her. You want to hear it?"
6166,Yeah.,"She made me switch to light Mayo. That's it! That's all I got! And, you know what? It tastes the same and my pants fit better!"
6167,"Joey, I just think you're getting worked up over nothing. This is probably just a crush.",You think?
6168,"Absolutely! Y'know, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes away.","Yeah, just a crush! That's all this is! It's a crush! I'm Joey; I don't get deep feelings."
6169,"That's right, there you go! Crushes happen all the time! I know I've had them for all you guys. Well, except for Ross and Chandler. And I'm sure you've had them for us.",Not really.
6170,Really? Lee Majors is hot!,Hello?
6171,We're in the bathroom!,Why?
6172,Because it's a relaxing and enjoyable time!,What are you guys doing in here?
6173,You like Rachel?!,"It's no big deal, okay? Phoebe and I talked about it. It's just a crush! It's going to go away! Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles! Oh!"
6174,,"""All right. It's a new day, and it's just a crush, that's all! Just a little crush! All that worrying I was doing, that was crazy. Crazy! Like my friend here the bird would say, """"it was cuckoo!"""" Everything's going to be fine. It's just a crush."""
6175,"Hi, sweetie.",I love you.
6176,,"Oh okay, okay! One more push! One more push! Come on honey, we're almost there! We're almost there!"
6177,"Oh Joey, I'm so happy things worked out for us that we're having this baby together. I love you so much.","Oh, I love you too."
6178,"And I hope it's not an inappropriate time to say this but, you're the best sex I ever had.","That's always appropriate! Oh, okay. One more push! One more push!"
6179,Joey! Joey!,What? What's going on?
6180,Come feel this! Come feel my belly!,Aaaah...
6181,Joey! The baby is kicking for the first time! Will you please come feel this?!,Really?!
6182,,"Oh, y'know what? Maybe uh, you...you should come to me. I'm a not, I'm not wearing any bottoms."
6183,"Oh, okay!","Oh my, oh my God!"
6184,"Aw, it's unbelievable! Wow! She is kicking so much! Oh, she's like umm...oh...who's that kind of annoying girl soccer player?",Mia Hamm?
6185,Mia Hamm!,Oh that's amazing.
6186,Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!,Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!
6187,Hey!,Hey Ross! The baby's kicking!
6188,Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey's room and he was sleeping...,A dreamless sleep.
6189,"My God, the baby's kicking. That's great. Although I...kinda wish I-I would've been there to feel the kicking for the first time y'know.",Well I got stuff going on in here if you wanna feel.
6190,"Look, I-I don't want to miss anymore baby stuff. So...Here. Here's my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it! I'll be there! Okay? I don't care if it's three in the morning and all you want is ice cream.",Wow! Can I get a copy of that?
6191,I wasn't trying to open your closet! I wasn't trying to open your closet! I swear!,"Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?"
6192,Monica has a secret closet and she won't let me see what's in it.,Why not?
6193,I don't know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I can't see?!,"I don't know. Ooh, I bet it's Richard."
6194,Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?,"Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe she's having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!"
6195,And here we go...,"I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. Y'know it wouldn't kill ya to respect your wife's privacy! Stupid closet full of bugs!"
6196,"Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I don't-Whoa!!","Oh hey whoa-whoa, don't worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnant they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing."
6197,Really?,"Absolutely. But, we're gonna stop by the hospital just to be sure, okay? I'll page Ross on the way. Come on."
6198,Okay. Oh God-Ow!-Oo!,"Okay Rach-Rach-Rach look at me, look at me, everything's gonna be fine, trust me. Okay. Take my hand. Here we go. Oww crushing bones!"
6199,,Hey! So?
6200,"Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it you've had one of these Braxton thingies?",So but everything is normal.
6201,Absolutely.,And-and there's no danger to her and the baby?
6202,Thank you doctor. Oh thank you for being so nice and calm.,Calm?! I wasn't calm! I've never been more scared in all my life!
6203,But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.,Well what do I know?! I'm not a doctor!
6204,But I-But everything is okay. I'm fine!,You sure?!
6205,"Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctor's uterus though. Mild discomfort, what's he talking about?",Oh hey-hey!
6206,"Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened?",Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.
6207,"Okay, no uterus, no opinion.","Hey uh, what's with the candy?"
6208,"So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.","Oh hey, don't worry about it man. Don't worry about it, no big deal."
6209,"Uh, if you have any questions, here's some information on Braxton-Hicks. Oh and by the way, you did the right thing by bringing her in. You're gonna make a wonderful father.","Oh uh, hey. Not as good as this guy! He brought Twizlers!"
6210,There has got to be a way!,"Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?"
6211,"Yeah. Oh no wait, I'm not an nine-year-old girl.",Then why do you throw like one?
6212,Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.,"""Sure. """"Monica."""""""
6213,"So, how's the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?","Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now. Wow, you sure found that quick. I just-I wish I didn't feel this way about Rachel anymore, y'know? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I think...I think Ross feels left out. Y'know? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. God... You should've seen the look on Ross's face. By the way, I have no idea what I'm doing here. For all I know I'm just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?"
6214,That's a good idea.,Yeah.
6215,"Okay. So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?","Oh, I just...I feel terrible."
6216,What?! What?! Rach what?!,What's going on?
6217,"I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.",Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.
6218,"Yeah, I'll be fine. But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when I get out there?",I'm on it!
6219,I can't believe this! I shouldn't be the one making her throw up!,Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.
6220,"Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna.","Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?"
6221,What's up?,"Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation."
6222,Are you breaking up with us?,"The thing is...'cause I live with Rachel I'm here for a lot of the stuff, okay? And Ross...Ross is missing everything. So..."
6223,Yeah?,Maybe you two should live together.
6224,Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?,"Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you. It just seems that...if you're gonna have a roommate, y'know it might as well be the father."
6225,So? Sure! But it-it wouldn't be anything romantic. And I'm-I'm dating Mona-Damnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour ago! What is wrong with me?!,"All right now, so? What do you think?"
6226,"No! No it's not. Joey, this is a smart idea.","Well, I was due."
6227,Hey.,Hey.
6228,So Rachel's all moved out huh? How are you taking it?,"Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because Rachel couldn't stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. And uh, it's a couple weeks past it's expiration date, so it's got a bit of a kick."
6229,Are you okay?,"Are you kidding me? I'm great! Yeah, I'm uh; I'm better than great. I am good. And now that she's gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff around here that I couldn't do before. Y'know? Like umm, I can walk around naked again. Y'know? I can uh, I can watch porn in the living room. Right? This is uh, this is good for me. Y'know? I like being on my own, I'm uh, better off this way. I'm uh, a lone wolf. Y'know? A loner. Alone. All alone. Forever. What's a wolf got to do to get a huh around here?!"
6230,"Oh, you, too.","Hey, so, uh, how's it going living over at Ross'?"
6231,Okay.,Bye.
6232,,There's one lucky to-go cup of coffee.
6233,"Honey, I wish you would get over her. I hate seeing you like this. Is there anything I can do for you? Do you want to look down my top?",Thanks. But maybe later.
6234,You want anything?,You know what I want? I want a lot of things! I want to be with the woman I love on Valentine's Day! And I want her to love me back! And I want just one moment of relief from the gut-wrenching pain of knowing that that's never going to happen!
6235,We have red bagels.,"Oh, okay."
6236,"Hey. Look, I know you've been really depressed lately, so I brought someone over to cheer you up. Right outside this door is a real, live, furry playmate.","No, I'm not sleeping with your friend Jane again."
6237,He-hee!,"Hey! A dog! Hi! Who, you got to admit, looks a lot like Jane."
6238,"This is the happiest dog in the world. I borrowed him from my friend Wendy. Now, you can only keep him until he cheers you up. And he will cheer you up!","Thanks so much, Pheebs! We are going to have so much fun, yes we are! Oh! Not that kind of fun."
6239,,"Get the ball, ready? Get the ball, get the ball! Well, you're cute, but you're not too smart!"
6240,,Did I just throw this?
6241,Hi.,Hi.
6242,I accidentally packed these with my stuff. Who is this?,"Oh, that's, uh, that's Phoebe's friend's dog. I don't know what his real name is, but I call him Mozzarella."
6243,"Oh, well, you are so cute! I wish I could play with you more, but I've got to go to work! I hope I stop talking like this before my marketing meeting, yes I do. Yes I do. Bye-bye, Joey. Oh, I seriously can't stop it.","C'mere. Hey. C'mere. That's Rachel. She's the one who used to live here. Might as well be honest with you-we love her. But we can't have her. I really miss her. Well, hey, you understand, right? You're a guy. Well, you used to be."
6244,,"So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it just isn't going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat."
6245,Hey!,Hey.
6246,"Hey, buddy. How's my favorite dog, huh? How's my favorite dog? You're subdued. Did you give him a beer?",No.
6247,"Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment.","Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Oh, me, right!"
6248,He's miserable! What happened to him?,Nothing. We just talked about stuff.
6249,What stuff?,Rachel stuff.
6250,"Oh...Joey, you bummed him out! This was the happiest dog in the world, and he spends half a day with you, and look at him!",He's breathing!
6251,"Okay, I'm going to take him back to Wendy's.","No, no, no, no! He's fine! Look, look, look! Here's your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! My God, what have I done to you, huh? I broke the dog! Pheebs, I broke the dog!"
6252,"Hey, hey, man!","Hey, what's up?"
6253,Uh...Mona just dumped me.,"Oh, man, I'm sorry. Why?"
6254,"Well, with everything that's been going on lately, I haven't exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I, uh, I didn't tell her I got Rachel pregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?","Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentine's Day."
6255,"Yeah. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Joey Tribbiani without a date on Valentine's Day? What's going on, huh? Girl trouble?",Sort of.
6256,Really?!,You don't have to seem so happy about it.
6257,"Oh, sorry. Well, look, maybe I can help you with it.","Oh, I...I d-"
6258,"Anyway, so, uh, so what is it?",Forget about it. It's no big deal.
6259,C'mon! Joey! What is it?,It's nothing.
6260,"Hey, hey, it's me. Why can't you tell me?","Okay, uh...sit down. Um... there's this woman that I like. A lot. But, uh...it can't happen."
6261,She's not a Tribbiani?,No!
6262,"I knew it. So, is she someone from work?",Yes.
6263,"Well, uh, does she like you?","Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesn't matter, because I can't do anything about it."
6264,Why not?,"Well, it's complicated. She's with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because we're really good friends."
6265,"So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh... is he still in love with her?",No. I don't think so.
6266,Okay. Um... is he a good guy?,"Yeah, he's the best."
6267,Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.,"Oh, I don't know."
6268,"Joey, it's worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.","I do! So much! I can't stop thinking about her! I can't sleep, I-"
6269,"I'm going to...uh...I'm going to, um, put the bourbon in it at home.","Oh, yeah."
6270,"Anyway... seriously, uh...just...just talk to the guy, okay? And tell me how it goes.",It's Rachel.
6271,,"There's this woman, that I like. A lot. Well, it's complicated. She's with this other guy. For a long time. And I could never do that to the guy, y'know? 'Ccause we're really good friends."
6272,"So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh... is he a good guy?","Yeah, he's the best."
6273,Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.,"Oh, I don't know."
6274,"Joey, it's worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.","I do! So much! I can't stop thinking about her! I can't sleep, I-"
6275,"Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.",It's Rachel.
6276,"Did you um-I'm sorry, did you just say it's Rachel?",Yes.
6277,"Um, you...you like Rachel?",Yes. I like Rachel.
6278,Rachel?!,"Yeah, okay but look, buy uh-Hey-hey, y'know, y'know who else I like? You! And it-it doesn't get said enough. I like you Ross."
6279,But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?!,"Yeah, but it's not a big deal."
6280,"It's not a big deal? Oh, I'm sorry I just...um, I...what about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I like-you-you can't stop thinking about her. Like how you can't sleep?","I'm an actor, y'know? As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic."
6281,Rachel who's carrying my baby? Rachel?,"Look no, I-I know it's bad, and I know it's wrong. Okay? But-but it's not like anything's ever gonna happen. Y'know? These-these are just feelings, they're gonna go away."
6282,Y'know what? I-I gotta go.,Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross don't...
6283,,Hey.
6284,Hey.,"Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it."
6285,"No, I don't want to hit you.",Oh what then? Kick me?
6286,No.,Bite me?
6287,"No, no I don't want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to tell you that I'm not mad at you and...and that I certainly do not hate you. I just, I just came here to say that.",Oh now-Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?
6288,Uh...yeah sure.,"Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left. I don't..."
6289,Okay.,"Hey look Ross, you need to understand something okay? I uh...I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you."
6290,,"Anyway, it uh...look it'll just...take me a while to get over her, that's all. I'm not even sure how to do that, I mean I've never been in love before so..."
6291,What?! You're in love with her.,"Yeah, I thought you knew that."
6292,"Umm, no.","""Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I don't want to feel this way. Honest. I just keep thinking, """"Ah, I'll get over this."""" Y'know? I just-It just keeps gettin' harder. I don't, I don't know what to do. Y'know? What do I do?"""
6293,I think you need to tell her how you feel.,Okay that's the green stuff talkin'.
6294,"No, I'm serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if she's not where you are, then you can start to move past this.",But what if uh-and I'm not saying she will be-But...
6295,If she is where you are then uh...then my feeling weird about it shouldn't stand in the way.,Are you sure?
6296,"Yeah. Look if-if she's gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldn't find a better guy. So...",Hey thanks.
6297,So when do you think you're gonna talk to her?,Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven't even thought about what I will say. What should I say?
6298,"I'm understanding, but let's not get carried away.","I'm sorry, you're right. What am I gonna say? Oh!"
6299,,"Okay. Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just stand up straight. Take a couple deep breaths. Look confident."
6300,Joey? What's up?,"I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something."
6301,Okay what's up?,Here? In the hall? What are we animals?
6302,"Well honey, I'm late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?","Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that I...want to have dinner with you tonight. That's all."
6303,Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you. Okay?,"Okay. That's good. Okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what you're gonna say. Good. Yeah. Don't you people ever knock?!"
6304,...and I know Chandler is kidding but it happens every time he touches my stomach. I mean I'm really worried the baby's not going to like him. Are you okay?,"What? Yeah! Sure! Uh, look at the uh, the reason...-Is it hot in here?"
6305,"No. Not-not for me, but why don't you take off your sweater?","I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbs."
6306,Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?,Yeah. Sure.
6307,"Huh. Wow, I wouldn't think Hobbs would like that so much.",Uh... How long have we known each other?
6308,"Um, seven...e-e-eight, eight years. Wow.","Uh-huh, long time."
6309,Yeah.,But over the past few weeks...
6310,"Hah, sorry about the wait, but it is mega-jammed in here! We have a couple specials tonight...","Actually uh, could you give us a second?"
6311,So you were saying?,I'm not quite sure.
6312,"""Okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and I said, """"Eight years."""" And the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, and umm...now here we are.""","Yeah, here we are. Uhh... I... I think I'm...falling in love with you."
6313,What?,I'm falling in love with you.
6314,"Who are you talking too? Oh, you're kidding! Oh, it's a joke! It's funny. It's funny. I don't get it. Oh. Okay. Umm... I-I...uh, wow. Are you uh... How did umm... When?",Does it really matter?
6315,"Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow, it is hot in here.","Okay look Rach, I know this is a lot. You don't have to say anything. You-you uh, you take as much time as you need. Okay, you gotta say something!"
6316,"Joey, Joey I love you so much, but I...",But.
6317,Joey.,"Yeah-yeah right. That's okay. That's fine. That's uh, pretty much what I was expecting. So uh, it's no big deal. All right? I think I'm gonna go."
6318,"No! Joey please! Please don't! Please don't leave like this! Now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman!","Don't start doing that. You can't do that Rach, 'cause then you're gonna make me do that. Oh, here we go!"
6319,Can I?,Sure!
6320,Oh Joey honey I don't...I don't want to lose...,"Hey-hey-hey, hey! You can't. Okay? Ever!"
6321,I'm so sorry.,"Oh no-no Rach, please, don't be sorry. Okay? Don't be sorry. Y'know I was only kidding you."
6322,,Oh God! That's Rachel!
6323,"Joey, you have to talk to her!","No-no, I can't! I can't! Not after the other night, it's just it's...too weird, okay? Don't tell her I'm here! Don't eat that!"
6324,"Okay, did you hear that?","Yeah, a naked bagel game? Dude, I don't know. That's a pretty small hole."
6325,"Honey, you gotta talk to her.",I can't! Y'know? You guys don't know what it's like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.
6326,"Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are mean when they're hungry.","All right so, so what do I do?"
6327,"This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to her again? I mean I know it's weird, it's awkward, but you gotta at least try.",Yeah. Okay. Whoa! I almost forgot this was on your...
6328,Hi!,Hey.
6329,Hi.,Hi.
6330,They were just giving those away at the store in exchange for money.,Hey!
6331,"Yeah Joey she's...Rachel's got this really big work problem, and it is a head scratcher. Wow! Y'know what, if we're gonna make dinner we're gonna have to leave. Yeah.","So you uh, have a...big work problem?"
6332,Yeah it's umm... Yeah it's uh... It-it's y'know-It's nothing.,"Huh. Okay. So uh, I think I'm gonna take off."
6333,Yeah-No wait! Joey no wait it is. It's something. It's-it's umm...it's my boss.,Yeah?
6334,"Yeah, and umm my baby.",Yeah?
6335,My boss wants to buy my baby!,What?! Oh my-oh my God!
6336,"I know I told you, it's a really big problem.",What he wants to buy your baby?!
6337,Can you believe that?!,That's crazy!
6338,That's what I told him!,"Okay, how did this even happen?"
6339,"""Well I'll tell ya! See uh my-my boss and his wife-They-they can't have children. So umm, and that-we were at the Christmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, """"Rachel, I want to buy your baby.""""""",Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figured it was something about maternity leave.
6340,May I help you?,Do you think you can just buy my friends baby?!
6341,The sun'll come out...tomorrow! Bet...your bottom dollar that tomorrow... ...there'll be sun.,Hey!
6342,"Hey! Oh Joey, honey listen, thank you for talking to my yesterday about that thing with my boss. That really meant a lot.","Not a problem. Oh, and just so you know, that guy's not going to be bothering you about that baby thing anymore."
6343,What?,Let's just say I took care of it.
6344,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, let's say more!","""Don't worry! Don't worry. I just told him, very nicely, """"You don't go buying people's babies, so back off!!"""""""
6345,"No! No, no-no-no Joey he doesn't want to buy my baby! I made that up!",What?! Why?!
6346,So that we would have something to talk about! So it wouldn't be awkward!,And you couldn't think of anything else?!
6347,"Oh Joey, I can't believe you brought my boss into this! I'm gonna get fired!",You lied to me!
6348,Hi.,So? What-what-what happened?
6349,"Joey, I'm really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to make things...",I know. I know.
6350,"It kinda worked. I mean y'know, I don't know about you buy I haven't thought about our thing since all this.","Hey you're right. Yeah, it's kinda been like us again a little bit."
6351,Yeah I know! I miss that.,Me too. I mean I...haven't thought at all about how I put myself out there and said all that stuff and how you didn't feel the same way about me and-and how it was really awkward.
6352,Sure. Yeah.,"So, who's the guy?"
6353,"""No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him, and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, """"God, your brother."""" Know what they'll say this year? """"God, you""""""","Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying. I'm an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue."
6354,Really you can do that?,Are you kidding me? Watch! Well I can't do it with you guys watching me!
6355,Hey!,Hey!
6356,You got a present for my parents. That's so sweet.,"Yeah, yeah, in honor of their 35th wedding anniversary, I had a star named after them."
6357,Aww that is so cool.,And I got them a book on Karma Sutra for the elderly.
6358,Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.,"I have to go to the bathroom too, but I don't want him complimenting my thing."
6359,I feel terrible.,I know.
6360,,"Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were being jerks. Parker's a nice guy and I'd like to get to know him."
6361,Then you better do it now.,Why?
6362,Because I'm going to kill him,What-what?
6363,"You guys were right. He's just too excited about...everything. I mean I'm all for living life, but this is the Geller's 35th anniversary. Okay? Let's call a spade a spade this party stinks.","I know I'm having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!"
6364,Are you sure it wasn't an oyster?,"I guess it could've been, I didn't really look at it. Y'know, I just wiped it on Chandler's coat and got the hell out of there."
6365,He's just such a great guy I'm so excited about him.,"Oh hey, you should be excited about him. There's nothing wrong with him he's a good guy."
6366,You think?,Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.
6367,"You're right. You're right, he's just embracing life. We could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I'm a sunny, positive person.","Actually, you have a little bit of an edge."
6368,What's that now?,Nothing...
6369,"So, I'm in my apartment doing the Soap Opera Digest crossword puzzle, and guess who the clue is for three down.","Three down, Days Of Our Lives star blank Tribbiani. That's me!! I'm blank!!"
6370,How cool is this?! We know three down! I'm touching three down!,Yeah you are baby.
6371,So did they call you to tell you your name's gonna be in this?,"No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no."
6372,Why'd you say no?,"Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time."
6373,"Okay, don't listen to him. Please?","Fine! All right, I'll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I y'know, start to say something stupid."
6374,"Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal Rachel Green. Ha-ha! I'm gonna be in Soap Opera Digest! And not just in the dumb crossword puzzle. Seriously, proud of you.",Yeah.
6375,I really appreciate you taking the time to do this.,"Oh, not at all. Happy to do it."
6376,Y'know I think its great you wanted to meet here. Y'know when most people hear the magazine is paying for it they want to go to a big fancy restaurant.,"Actually, I didn't know the magazine was paying for it. Wouldn't have mattered, I'm doing this for the fans, not for the free food."

6507,"Uh well, the game was too complicated and research showed people didn't follow it.",Well what's complicated? You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up the Ladder of Chance. You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden Monkey; you yank his tail and boom! You're in Paradise Pond!
6508,Yeah all that's gone. It's basically just a simple question and answer game now.,Well what's fun about that? You expect me to be the host of a boring game that's just people standing around answering questions?

6516,Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well... I'm getting my revenge!,You cooked him?
6517,I don't see any reason why I would do that to myself again.,"Either eat it, or be in it."

6542,You really want to take me?,"Yeah! Yeah! I mean I'm sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but y'know Chandler always supported my career. He's paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back."
6543,"Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots you're gonna take him? Joey, I don't think you're comprehending just how slutty this dress is!","It's not just the stuff he paid for, I mean it's-it's everything. Y'know? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didn't get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man.

6604,"Cliff, do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in your room?","Rachel's having her baby!! Which is of no interest to me, I'm a neurologist."
6605,I don't believe this. You got him to pretend he was some fake doctor?,Fake? Excuse me? Hello?
6606,I don't think so.,"Uh, if I may? Umm-umm look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right? And maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personal stuff about her. Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer. Uh, she gave birth to her brother's triplets. Oh! Oh! Her-her twin sister used to do porn!"
6607,"Uh Joey, we're trying to dial down the crazy.",Right!
6608,It doesn't happen to me either.,Me neither.
6609,Hi!,There she is!
6610,"It's incredible, I mean one minute she's inside you and then 47 hours later here she is.",She looks so real! Y'know what I mean! She's this whole tiny little person. She already has eyelashes and knees and...uh-oh.
6611,What?,"Oh no-no, no for I second there I counted six fingers, but one was from the other hand so we're good."
6612,So? You guys are all sleep deprived. I don't see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet. Oh God.,What's the matter now?
6613,So then I guess Ferdinad is out.,What was the other one Ross?
6614,,Hey. I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time; it is like a freak show up here. What's the matter?
6615,Nothing.,What is it? Hey!
6616,Really it's nothing. I'm just...,"Rach come on, what?"
6617,I've just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.,What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
6618,"Oh please, he'll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.","Okay, how long was I watching that woman?"
6619,"I'm just saying that y'know, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and...he's gonna have his own life. Right?","Yeah, I guess so."
6620,I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?,"Hey, listen to me, listen to me...you are never ever gonna be alone. Okay? I promise that's not gonna happen."
6621,,You don't have to worry about that okay?
6622,"Oh, hon can you grab me my other box of tissues? They're right on that chair under Ross's coat.",Sure.
6623,,My God.
6624,So uh...I guess we should...make it official huh?,Uh... Look Rach... Hey Ross is here! Hey look! It's my good friend Ross. Hey Ross.
6625,Hey you.,"Hey and look he brought flowers. Thanks Ross, but I'm really more of a candy guy."
6626,"Uh Joey, can you give us just a minute?",No.
6627,What?,"Oh, I'm sorry. I meant no."
6628,"I know, I still need to talk to you.","Oh hey but, before you guys do that I need to talk to you, and Ross, I need to talk to you."
6629,"Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has my Gameboy.","Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?"
6630,Sure.,Dude I just did something terrible.
6631,That was you?! I thought it was Jack!,"No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!"
6632,What?! Why does she think that?,Because it kinda looked like I did.
6633,"Again, what?!","Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand."
6634,As we all are at some point during the day.,It wasn't my ring! It fell out of Ross's jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!
6635,Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?,I guess.
6636,And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!,I know! I know it's awful.
6637,"Well, what did she say?",She said yes.
6638,Does Ross know?,"Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?"
6639,Well maybe you don't have to tell him anything.,"Oh, I like that. Yeah."
6640,"If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!",Now let's not get carried away.
6641,Especially Ross!,"Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y'know what? I'll-I'll come back later."
6642,I think there are people in there having sex.,"It can't be me, I'm standing right here."
6643,Y'know what? I don't like you without mom. Come on.,We're not peeking?
6644,,"Hey uh, is it okay to come in?"
6645,"Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I...it's beautiful I love it!","Yeah uh look Rach, there's something I gotta tell ya."
6646,"It's all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it, but don't worry. It'll happen.",Yowsa!
6647,"Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.",Dear Lord.
6648,"I'm sorry honey, what were you saying?","Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that."
6649,"Oh look, she's pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth? She looks scared. Doesn't she look scared?","Y'know, I don't really know her."
6650,Why don't we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow.,Are you kidding me?!
6651,It's just so frustrating! Why doesn't she want my breast?!,I don't know! Maybe she's crazy!
6652,You still haven't told Rachel you weren't really proposing?,"No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out."
6653,"Joey, you have to tell her what's going on! And what did it look like?!",I didn't look at it. Stupid baby's head was blocking most of it.
6654,Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.,"Look, it's not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I don't want to hurt her."
6655,"Okay, look, just do it gently.","You're right. You're right. I-I'll go tell her now before Ross finds out and I'll be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by the way. Two people screwing in there if you want to check that out."
6656,Joey proposed to you?,I can come back.
6657,"Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?",No.
6658,Yes you did!,"Actually, technically, I didn't."
6659,"Wait! Whoa-whoa, you...you gave her the ring?","No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!"
6660,"Yes, you did!","No, I didn't!"
6661,"Yes, you did!","No, I didn't!"
6662,"""Yes, you did! And don't you say, """"No, I didn't!""""""",Ahhh!
6663,Whoa! You were down on one knee?,"Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didn't...I didn't propose!"
6664,"Yeah, what did happen?","Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you thought I was proposing."
6665,"""Yeah, but you said, """"Will you marry me?""""""","No, I didn't!"
6666,"Yes, you did!","No, I didn't!"
6667,"Yes, you did-Oh my God you didn't! Well then why didn't you tell me that before?!","Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!"
6668,"Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!",I'll tell you about it later. Be cool.
6669,"Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!","It wasn't my ring! It's Ross's ring! That's why I felt so bad Rach, because he was going to propose."
6670,Uhh... No.,"Well, this is awkward."
6671,"But I-I was going to see if y'know, maybe you uh, start dating again but that-I mean that-that was all, Rach.","Dude, step up! I proposed."
6672,"No, you didn't!",Oh that's right. There's a lot going on here and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.
6673,I can't believe you told her I was going to propose!,I can't believe you're not going to propose!
6674,"Hey, I'm not going to rush into anything!","Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with a woman I like to slow things down!"
6675,"She's doing it Look, she's breast-feeding look!","Ah, it's beautiful."
6676,Wonderful weird.,"Y'know what you guys? I'm uh, I'm gonna go too. And uh, I'm sorry about everything."
6677,"Honey don't worry, it was my mistake.","No, Rach, I should've told you sooner. It's just that...Man! That kid is going to town!"
6678,Ooooo!,"Hey you guys I'm gonna take off. I just wanted to let you guys know, say goodbye."
6679,Rachel said she'd marry you?!,"This isn't the right room, sorry folks."
6680,"No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the office Am I producing them?",Why're you so tired?
6681,"Couldn't sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more I couldn't sleep. Y'know? I was like, if I fall asleep now I'll get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I'll get five hours sleep. Not matter what I did I couldn't fall asleep.","You know what you should've done, you should have told yourself that little story."
6682,"Oh Ah! Oh my gosh there's something every mother needs, a giant stuffed gorilla that takes up the entire apartment! What are people think... Oh you guys I love it.",Hey so where's Ross?
6683,He's downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the cab.,Is he still mad at us?
6684,"Well, you more then me, but he can't stay to mad at me. I mean, I just had his baby.",That's not fair! I can't do that.
6685,"Yeah, I'm not so sure you should be here when he comes up.","See this is what I was afraid of, I didn't think I should be here either but somebody said he'd be over it by now."
6686,Huh? Ooh you mean like a... Huh?,"Hey. Ross, I know you're pissed at me, but we have to talk about this."
6687,Ah actually we don't.,"Fine, fine okay. But I gotta say technically, I didn't even do anything wrong."
6688,What! You didn't do anything wrong?!,I said I didn't technically.
6689,"""Okay let's put aside that you """"accidentally"""" picked up my grandmothers ring and you """"accidentally"""" proposed to Rachel.""","Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this I don't really know what that means. You were saying?"
6690,"And I can even understand that you couldn't tell Rachel, but why couldn't you tell me, huh? You had all day to and you didn't.","""I know I should've. """"I'm sorry."""""""
6691,I'm gonna go.,"No, come on Ross! Look, Ross, we have to get past this."
6692,Give me the bag.,"No, look, I don't know what else to do. I said I'm sorry!"
6693,Joey!,"You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me."
6694,I'm not gonna hit you.,"Why not? You'll feel better! I'll feel better, and you know you want to. I can see it in your eyes."
6695,No I don't.,A little bit.
6696,No.,Little bit.
6697,No!,A little bit more.
6698,Give me the bag.,"No, hit me."
6699,Give me the bag.,Hit me.
6700,"Joey, give me the bag.",Hit me!
6701,Joe I'm not kidding.,"Hit me, hit me."
6702,No!,Hit me! Hit me!
6703,You ducked!!,I'm sorry! It was a reflex!
6704,"Oh my god, this really hurts!!!","I couldn't help it! When a fist comes at your face, you duck! Look!"
6705,What is the matter with you?!?,You were supposed to duck!!! Why didn't you duck?
6706,Why don't we talk about this on the way to the hospital?,"""Good, good yeah, maybe while we're there, they can check your reflexes. """"Oops."""""""
6707,,"Hey, so how is it?"
6708,I broke my thumb.,Your thumb? That's weird. You sure you're punching right? Make a fist. Maybe later. Ross I feel terrible.
6709,"You know what, you can go, I just have to fill out some forms.","You, you want me to help you with that?"
6710,"Why, does it look like I'm having trouble with my misshapen claw?","Name? I know Ross but what's it short for? You know like, like Rossel or Rosstepher."
6711,Just Ross!,"It's pretty, Okay date of birth?"
6712,You know my birthday.,"Sure, May...tember."
6713,October 18th.,Occupation? Dinosaurs.
6714,Actually I'm a palian... Dinosaurs is fine... the drawing is not.,"Alright, who do you want as your emergency contact?"
6715,"Ah, Rachel I guess.","Okay, relationship, boy this could take a while."
6716,Just ah... just put roommate.,"Come on, you guys are more then that! I mean, you're gonna get together right?"
6717,I don't think that we are.,But you two were supposed to be together.
6718,"Well, I thought so too, but then she said she'd marry you.","Come on, Ross, that didn't mean anything! She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody."
6719,Yeah that's what she said.,So?
6720,So I don't wanna be just anybody.,Wow.
6721,"You know what, it's, it's better this way anyway. I mean I don't know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. It's just much easier if we're just friends who have a kid.",Really?
6722,Yeah.,And you're Okay with that?
6723,"Yes. I mean, it's what we always planned. And if you have a plan, you should stick to it. That's why they call them plans. Hello? I'm fine.","""Hey, for what it's worth, with Rachel I don't think you'll ever be just """"anybody."""""""
6724,Hey there you go!,"""""""Thanks."""""""
6725,,"You know, ah, I've been thinking about this and I gotta tell ya, it's not my fault. It's a natural instinct."
6726,"Hey, what you guys talking about?","Hey OK great, what would you do if I did this?"
6727,Monday?!,How long do you have to go for?
6728,They said it could be up to a year.,A year?!
6729,"There is nothing like the support of your loving wife, huh?","Wait a minute, you can't go to Tulsa. Maybe you forgot, but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week."
6730,"I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it.",We were gonna go see the Jets!
6731,Not you.,I can't believe you guys are moving.
6732,,Here you are.
6733,Yeah. Just to be sure I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.,
6734,Every time?,Uhuh.
6735,I'm on the phone! Dr. Wiener?,
6736,It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby. It's just so grown up.,"I know, yeah. I feel like we're all growing up. Person named Wiener, God that kills me."
6737,Look at you all grown up.,"Actually, you know what? I am. That whole thing with Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship. You know? Like I'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. And looks aren't as important as...Nah, she's gotta be hot."
6738,"You know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you set me up with someone, and we double date!","I can do that, yeah. How is Friday?"
6739,"Done. Oh good, really?",Yeah!
6740,"Let's see! Oh, you know who's great? Sandy Poophack.",Poophack...

6744,"Ooh, great! Just the reaction I was hoping for.","Yeah, so you found someone for me. You didn't forget?"
6745,"Of course not! And you're gonna love Mary Ellen. She's really smart and cute and funny, and I can't tell you how I know this, but she' not opposed to threesomes. So tell me some about my guy.",No.
6746,"Come on, give me something. What's his name?",Mike.
6747,Mike? Okay! What's his last name?,Damnit! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore!?
6748,"All right, we'll se you and Mike at the restaurant in a couple hours.",
6749,,Why did I have to say Mike? I don't know a Mike! Why couldn't I have said... There's no guy in there!
6750,,MIKE!!!
6751,Yeah?,Okay!
6752,"I gotta tell you, I can't believe I'm doing this with you. Although I did just get out of a nine-year relationship, so I guess I should be open and taking some risks.","Everything is gonna be fine. Just follow my lead, okay? All you have to do is pretend to be Mike."
6753,I am Mike.,Atta boy!
6754,Atta boy!,"Okay, look..."
6755,"How do I and Joey know each other? Wow, if I had a nickel for every time somebody has asked me that.",From school.
6756,"Well, I'm a lawyer.","Mike, 'attorney at law'!"
6757,"Actually, I just gave up my practice.",What? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.
6758,"Wow, that's great! I liked that better than the law thing, so...",Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to Mike.
6759,I thought you thought he was still a lawyer.,"No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail."
6760,"You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.","Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out. Mike hit my mom with a car."
6761,"No, I didn't.","That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're friends again everything's great! Mary Ellen Wait, is your mom okay?"
6762,"That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're friends again everything's great! Mary Ellen Wait, is your mom okay?","Please, we're trying to have a conversation."
6763,What?!,What?!
6764,Do you not know each other?,"Of course we do! Mike is playing a game that we used to play in high school. Yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other. We played all kinds of games. Hey, remember the one where I punch you in the face for not being cool?!"
6765,Six!,What are you doing? I said seven! Argh!!!
6766,"Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?","Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry."
6767,Who are you kidding? You just find some guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!,"Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like this guy I can find you a better one. Mike!! Mike!!"
6768,It was nice meeting you!,You're leaving too?
6769,I'll stay if you can tell me my name.,Good night!
6770,Okay. Do you think maybe sometime I could take you out?,
6771,"Oh, you just caught me off guard! Yeah, that would be nice.",Look at this. My two best friends!
6772,What's the matter Joe?,I'm mad at you for leaving! You're nothing but a big leaver. Big leaver with a stupid suitcase.
6773,Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make all this easier?,"Dude, you see right thru me!!"
6774,,Double promise? Call me when you land.
6775,Can I talk now?,"Okay, bye."

6808,,"see ordinarily I would talk to her, but my confidence is shaken did I sleep with her? Did I not sleep with her?"
6809,"you know maybe this is a wake up call, about your whole dating attitude.

6827,Happy birthday!,Son of a bitch!
6828,I'll give you another minute.,"Why are you going? He said, she wanted the shrew!"
6829,"You guys, we've been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order.","No, no, it's okay, I already told the waiter what they want."
6830,Why would you do that?,"Chandler, control your woman!"
6831,"well, this is, this is, this is not over! Hello?","Well, what is going on with you two?"
6832,You not gonna believe this: She lied! She tricked me into having sex with her.,"So? Did have sex, right?"
6833,Bye.,"See ya. Well, this is just us."
6834,"So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?","Do, do you gonna do it now?"
6835,We don't have much time. Once the egg descended the oviduct ...,No-ohoh.
6836,I sincerely hope the rest of your party is returning.,"Nah, just me. All alone. Dinner for six for one, uh, you boys are about to see something really special."
6837,"How was everything, sir?",Excellent. The shrew in particular was exclusive.
6838,"Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear ...",Joey! Joey.
6839,"... Joey, happy birthday to you.",That's the best birthday ever.
6840,"Yeah, I kinda do. Well, how's this?","Aaahhh, look at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious? Have you not talked about it yet? Am I making you uncomfortable? If you were bigger you'd hit me, huh...? Aaaaaahhhhhh."
6841,It really is.,"Oh, I know it... It is amazing these little things open doors... huh!"
6842,"Hey! I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks.",Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering lines.
6843,"Well, thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it.","I know, right? Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?"
6844,Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.,Seriously? She actually said that?
6845,Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?,Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!
6846,Yeah!,"""Without that, you just got """"lame with women""""."""
6847,Hi! There you are.,Fire trucks!
6848,Lighter than air... But that's not the point.,Hey!
6849,Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.,Really...? Guys do that...? That's... weird...
6850,Thank you!,That's like a woman wanting to be a...
6851,Yes... What is the end of that sentence?,"Uhm... A penis model. Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?"
6852,Wow!,Really? Do you not know Chandler?
6853,"Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...? Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey...","So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... You know, like Ross's thing is..."
6854,Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?,...No...
6855,I can't believe he's that upset about this...,"Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'Cause he's feeling like..."
6856,Hey!,Heeeyy! Hey!
6857,Did you tell her what we talked about?,Yeah....
6858,Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you!,Not knowing when to shut up...
6859,,"Yeah! Allright! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught me Hot-cross Buns."
6860,Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice.,Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this...
6861,Who's up for puppets?,Me! I'm up for puppets!
6862,Actually studies have shown that the movement and colours help their cerebral development... The whimsical characters are just for us.,I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch.
6863,"So you see Wigglemunch, that's why it's important to shaaaaaaare...",I am learning so much from you.
6864,I love you too. And... I like you as a friend.,Allright. See you later!
6865,See ya!,Did that guy really make that joke?
6866,"And what's the one kind of boat that can never, ever sink?",What kind?
6867,A friend-ship...,Wow! You blow my mind...
6868,"Oh, I gotta go.",Aaahh... How much do I owe you?
6869,Twenty bucks.,It's like the cheapest college ever.
6870,Hi!,Hey... hey listen... What do you guys know about investments?
6871,How come?,"Well, I'm starting to make good money on the show and I'm thinking... I should probably do something with it."
6872,What do you do with your money now?,"Well, I just tape it to the back of my toilet tank. I didn't say that! It's in a bank guarded by robots!"
6873,Do you have any ideas?,"Uh, yeah... This guy at work got me excited about going in on an emu farm. That'd be kinda cool huh? Pitchin' in on the weekends, helping to plant the emus..."
6874,Joe... Emus are birds. You raise them for meat.,"""Yeah! Right! People eat birds... Bird meat... Now do they just fly into your mouth or you go to... you go to a restaurant and you say: """"Excuse me, I'll have a bucket of fried bird."""" Or... or maybe just a wing or..."""
6875,"Joey, I think you should consider something a little less risky. I mean, I think in this market, real estate is your best investment.The Fed. just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible. That's right, I know some stuff!","Real estate, huh? Hmmm..."
6876,"Oh hi, come on in. I'm Catherine, the listing agent.",Hi I'm Joey. This is Chandler.
6877,mmm That's enough about you!,Is there anything we should know about the apartment?
6878,"Oh... Okay, sorry!","Well, you seem pretty insulted by that. What? I'm not good enough for you?"
6879,"We're not gonna have this conversation again... Look at this place. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art, this huge macho couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing Monica to a real man! You don't think he's here, do you?","You know what it is? It's a nice place but I gotta see I don't know if I see myself living here. Oh, oh, oh, let me see... Yeah, I could see it."
6880,"Look at these videos. You know, I mean, who does he think he is? Magnum Force, Dirty Harry, Cool Hand Luke... Oh my God!",What?
6881,There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.,Ooh! A tape with a girls name on it. It's probably a sex tape... Wait a minute... This says Monica... And this is Richard's apartment...
6882,"I'm not gonna watch it... I don't NEED to watch it... I mean, what good could possibly come from watching? Well, we know I'm gonna watch it.","Hey dude, what's up?"
6883,"Don't judge me, I'm only human!",Did you take that tape?
6884,"I had to! Okay, imagine you were married... and you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... Wouldn't you need to know what was on it?",I don't know. Who'm I'm married to?
6885,Some girl...!?,She hot?
6886,Yeah...!?,How did she get me to settle down?
6887,"Allright, I'm gonna watch it... I mean look, it's probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possibly be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head... Can it?","Guess I don't know. My experience: if a girl says yes to being taped... She doesn't say no to much else, I tell ya..."
6888,Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.,What? Whoo... What?
6889,"Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... Please?","All right, fine... But if I enjoy this, you have only yourself to blame..."
6890,Why am I hearing cheering?,"Well it's okay, its like... its just a football game."
6891,Football? Just football?,"Yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing."
6892,It's football... It's just football... This is great! This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to get a beer... What the... What are you doing?,You don't wanna see what I just saw!
6893,That tape was never meant to be seen by... Joey I would feel more comfortable if I was having this conversation in private.,"Monica, look... I don't think you and I have any secrets anymore... Not ready to joke about it yet, okay, I see you later."
6894,"Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.","wow, the parade is really good this year. Man those horses can crap."
6895,And heres the float with the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives .,Oh my God!
6896,Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives?,Yeah! I totally forgot I'm supposed to be there. I can't believe I forgot. I usually write stuff like this on my arm. Oh! Stupid long sleeves.
6897,What are you going to do?,"""I guess I'm going to have to come up with a really good reason why I wasn't there. The producers are going to be so mad at me. They sat us all down yesterday and said """"Everyone has to be there at 6:00 AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani."""" Like.. like I was some kind of idiot."""
6898,Well you proved them wrong.,Yeah. Ross and Rachels Apartment.
6899,"Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving!",Hey happy Thanksgiving.. Pheebs!
6900,"Hey, what's going on Joe?",I.. I.. I need a good lie.
6901,"""Oh okay. How about the whole """"man walking on the moon"""" thing. You know? You. you could. You could see the strings people!""","No, no, no I need a good lie to explain why I wasn't at a work thing today."
6902,"Ooh, honey. You stink at lying.",I do not.
6903,"Oh really. Okay. let me ask you something. Yesterday at the coffee house, I went to the bathroom and when I came back, my muffin was gone-who took it?","""Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and I said """"Hey don't eat that-that's Phoebe's"""" and he said.. He said.. """"Joey you stink at lying."""" What am I going to do?"""
6904,"Don't worry, don't worry. We'll come up with a good lie. I'll help you practice it.","Oh great, that'd be great. Thank you."
6905,"Sure, what.. what was the work thing?",Uh..
6906,"""""""Pick up grandma at the airport""""?""",Oh.. man.. Ross and Rachel's Apartment.
6907,Oh my god. You're on Days of Our Lives.,Yeah.
6908,wow. They must put a lot of makeup on you.,Hap.. Hap.. Happy Thanksgiving.
6909,Oh. That's a funny noise.,"Pheebs, I still need some help here."
6910,"Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell. but its the way you tell it. . For example if you look down at the ground when you're talking, people know you're lying.",Oh.. I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know.. I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor.
6911,"Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved. Ross makes some sort of sound to let us know it hurt.",Hey! How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's? Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?
6912,"No, honey, its. thats a special plate. See its a game, whoever gets that plate wins.",I can't believe I won.
6913,"Hurts, doesn't it?",Uh.. who has to die for me to get her? Commercial Break.
6914,"No, that that is not what we're saying.",Yeah he's lying. He looked down.
6915,"Sure, Monica would have to give her up.","I lie better then that, right?"
6916,It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the parade because you had a family emergency.,"Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because I had a family emergency."
6917,No! Nothing with a raccoon.,"Arg... Alright, I'll take care of it. Monica and Chandler come through the front door."
6918,Oh wait.. What are you doing?,Setting the table.
6919,How hard could it be? You do it.,ooh oooh..
6920,Oh my god! Shouldn't we stop this?,What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello on them.
6921,Thank you. It was so beautiful. I'm going to go to Joeys and get the pies.,"Actually its not pies, its just pie."
6922,Maybe not even then.,"Hey! I did it. I called my producer. I told him I had a family emergency, he totally bought it. Thanks for teaching me how to lie Pheebs."
6923,Bye plates!,"Oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh?"
6924,What? Something happened with the plates?,Uhm... Yeah... this uhm... raccoon came in...
6925,Chandler Bing.,Hey. How come you're answering your own phone? Where's your crazy assistant?
6926,What's up Joe?,"Okay, what have we always wanted to do together?"
6927,Braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?,"No, no, no. When you get home tomorrow night, you and I are going to be at the Wizzards-Knicks game . . . courtside!"
6928,Courtside? Oh my God.,Yeah. Maybe Michael Jordon will dive for the ball and break my jaw with his knee.
6929,,"Wow! That didn't take long. I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three hour flight."
6930,There's no man in here. How dare you accuse me of that.,"All right. All right. Then, maybe you won't mind if me and my friend take a look around, huh? Bwa-ah-ah!"
6931,I arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.,"Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows."
6932,"All right. Well, I'll check the guest room.",Why do I smell men's cologne?
6933,I think that's you.,Oh yeah. I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.
6934,There's nobody here Joe.,I guess not.
6935,I can't believe you thought I was cheating. You own me an apology.,"Yeah, right Monica. I'm so sorry."
6936,"Ah, it's an honest mistake. It could happen to anyone. All right, see ya.","Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. If you just got back from Tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here?"
6937,,What's going on?
6938,"I'm sorry. I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend the night with Monica and I, I didn't know . . . I didn't think you'd understand.","""What? You think I'm too dumb to understand that a husband needs to be with his wife? Huh? Do you think I'm like, """"Duh."""""""
6939,Joey?,Yeah?
6940,Yeah. I feel so bad. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?,"Yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though I know you said you couldn't. But then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a bump on the head."
6941,I'm sorry. That's the one thing I can't do. I promised I'd be with Monica.,All right.
6942,Have fun.,Thanks. Here's your ticket.
6943,"Hey, listen. I'm never going to lie to you again, okay? And I want you to know that nobody thinks you're stupid.",Thanks man.
6944,Thanks man.,Where are you going?
6945,"""...sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle;and away they all flew like the down of a thistle; but I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, """"Merry Christmas to all, and to all a goodnight!""""""","Wow, that was great! You really wrote that?"
6946,"Oh, I like my job.",I *love* my job.
6947,,"Rach, these are for you."
6948,Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.,"No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do."
6949,"Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?",Uh-huh.
6950,You guuuyys.,"And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth."
6951,And last but not least.,They're ribbed for *your* pleasure.
6952,BE-LOW me!,"Ahh, wait, is Wendy the runner-up Miss Oklahoma?"
6953,Oh my god...,"Hey-heeyyy - Look at that, it's a Christmas miracle!"
6954,I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.,"Hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?"
6955,Monica.,Got ya.
6956,"I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys.",Mine's is to Lilian Myers.
6957,,Thank you!
6958,"Joey, can I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?",Okay. Phoebe Thank you. Thank you!
6959,Okay. Phoebe Thank you. Thank you!,": Pheebs, have you ever been bitten by a hungry Italian?"
6960,"I'm sorry, it's just, I'm a little short on cash.",If you want I could loan you some money?
6961,"Oh no, no, no. I learned never to borrow money from friends. No, that's why Richard Dreyfuss and I don't speak anymore.","Oh, hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show?"
6962,You could do that?,"Yeah, yeah. The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need."
6963,"Oh my god, I'm gonna be on TV!","Okay, now. I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think."
6964,"Oh, really?",No it is awesome!
6965,Rachel and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone. Doesn't she look cute?,She sure does. Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?
6966,"Joey, look at me! I'm a nurse!","Yes you are. I think it may be time for my sponge bath. Sorry, I'm just so used to hitting on the extras. So, are you excited about your scene?"
6967,Yeah! But I'm a little shaky and nervous.,"Oh, relax. Don't be. You'll be fine, you'll be fine. They'll probably just make you stand in the back."
6968,Cut!,"Hey, you know what? Don't worry, Pheebs! It usually takes me three takes too! Alright, eight."
6969,,Hey.
6970,"Hey. So, what did he say?","""Well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so I'm gonna replace a word he used a lot, with the word """"puppy."""" Okay, So He Said """"If your puppy friend doesn't get her puppy act together, I'm gonna fire her mother-puppy ass."""""""
6971,"I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm not an actor.","That's right, you're not. You're a nurse. You're Nurse With Tray."
6972,Joey.,"No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey, she doesn't have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesn't, people die!"
6973,Who dies?,Man With Eye Patch! You get in there and you do your job.
6974,"Yes, doctor.",Okay.
6975,"Joey, listen. I can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?","Oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. It's okay."
6976,"Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. And now suddenly I'm the waitress? That's gonna confuse my fans.","Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress."
6977,"Uhuh. Because I'm a single mother, supporting my two children.",Nice.
6978,Wait a minute. Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital. Wouldn't I come over to say hi to him?,"No, no. See, you and Drake are having a fight."
6979,About what?,He slept with you and then never called you.
6980,Me too!,"Oh, calm down! She means on the show! We need some new extras around here!"
6981,,Please don't fire my friend. Just let me talk to her.
6982,"Okay, okay. But this is her last chance.","Thank you, thank you. How about I do something for you? Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald?"
6983,"Thank you, thank you. How about I do something for you? Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald?","Hey, listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit Drake, you just wait on the tables?"
6984,I can't do that. I'm an actor. I have a process.,You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it.
6985,"Wait a minute, I see what's happening here. You're threatened.",What?
6986,"Yeah, I'm so good in this scene that I'm stealing focus from you. Well, rise to the challenge Tribianni 'cause I just raised the bar. Come join me up here!","Yeah, you can fire her, but I would call security, she won't go easy."
6987,Hey.,Hey. So where's Mon?
6988,"Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.",And you're not helping?
6989,"Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy.","You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes."
6990,Nice to meet you guys .,"Yeah, you too."
6991,And Joey?,How do you think she's doing?
6992,,"Man, I wish I had a nanny like you."
6993,"You mean, when you were a baby.",Sure.
6994,"Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if you didn't go after her.",Why not?
6995,"Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away.","So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? Yeah, sounds about right."
6996,"Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits.","Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can't have it makes me want her even more!"
6997,"What are you, a child?",Yes!
6998,"Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.",Fine.
6999,"Where you going, Joe?",For a walk.
7000,Oh. You mind if I join you?,"Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize my thoughts."
7001,Your thoughts? Plural?,"Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta see her!"
7002,"I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.","Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me! She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there?"
7003,"Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.",Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
7004,Great novels?,Fine ... mediocre porn.
7005,Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me!,"Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?"
7006,"Yeah, sure!","Oh ... Happy birth ... oh, see you later."
7007,,"So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work."
7008,So where did you study?,"Oh, I didn't go to college."
7009,"No, where did you study acting?",Molly ... people don't study acting ...
7010,Thanx.,Will the stable boy never get the princess??
7011,"What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?","No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real? Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again."
7012,Come on! Joe!,Ok.
7013,"Ok ... Well, uh, Joey, I guess we have no problem.","It's like my favorite fairy tale come true! The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!"
7014,,Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks Ishould have my eyebrows waxed. Is that weird for a guy?
7015,Well it depends.,On...?
7016,"No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to,your eyebrows are...",Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!
7017,Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...,Oh man! I have to get those done too?!

7028,"Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley Judd?","Look, I'll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my eyebrows shaped."
7029,"I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!","You may be a sissy but I'll still . All right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do oneeyebrow and now... they don't match!"
7030,It's like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!,"All right, look, you got to help me out, ok? Look, I have the magic marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one soI don't look stupid for my pictures."
7031,"Ok. First of all, this is green!",What the hell am I supposed to do!
7032,"All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.","What, what."
7033,"""Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mineby plucking the eyebrows of my father and his """"business"""" partners.""",Oh my God!

7037,"Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a little worried I was uncovering a birthmark right aboutthere, but it turned out to be a little piece of chocolate.",Thank you so much.
7038,No problem.,"Listen that's a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it."
7039,Yeah.,Comb my eyelashes.
7040,,Hey!
7041,Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while?,"Ha, oh, of course."
7042,Thank you.,Your eyebrows look weird.
7043,,"Morning, roomie!"
7044,Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.,Fifth day's a charm.
7045,"Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're making it so easy on me and Emma.","Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?"
7046,"Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep, so...",She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.
7047,"Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.","No, hey, it's been great."
7048,Yeah?,"Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump..."
7049,"Yeah, that'll do it.","Wow! So, how are you?"
7050,"I'm, I'm okay.",Really?
7051,"Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's a divorce.","Well, actually it..."
7052,"No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people.","Wow, really?"
7053,"Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good for me...","Sure, I know lots of girls."
7054,Yeah? Any names come to mind?,"Ooh, names? Opening credits."
7055,Hey.,Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something?
7056,What you got?,"Okay, let's see, we got strained peas, strained carrots... Ooh! Strained plums. We haven't tried that yet."
7057,"Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart from the great food.","I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody."
7058,"Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.",Why are they doing this?
7059,I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.,"You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in here?"
7060,I just wish they'd realise they should be together.,"I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know, that's where things were headed."
7061,I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children.,"Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name."
7062,"You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other.","Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck! But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom."
7063,"So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?",I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.
7064,"Yeah. Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together.","Ooh, that's a great plan!"
7065,"""Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my """"plan-laugh.""""""","Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh..."
7066,"Ooh, Joey.",Hey.
7067,Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight.,All right! Who is he?
7068,"Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.","Okay, okay. Wait till you hear who I got for Ross."
7069,"Oh, yeah.",She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!
7070,A teacher?,"Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh, oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?"
7071,"Well, Ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey, you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman!","Oh my god, you're right!"
7072,Yeah.,She even reads for pleasure!
7073,How do you even know a woman like that?,What? I'm not allowed to know smart women?
7074,Joey.,I met her at the library. I went in to pee.
7075,So now what do we do?,"Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else."
7076,"What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!",Ooh...I hear that's bad.
7077,"Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together.","Ah, yes, The Plan!"
7078,"It's not Santa's plan. No, it's...","Yeah, you know, it's not that fun."
7079,"Well, our plan is working. Rachel is having a miserable time, and Ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone.","Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together."
7080,"Okay, I'll try.",Hello?
7081,Hello?,Emma? Hey! Hi!
7082,Emma? Hey! Hi!,"How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the bedroom door closed?"
7083,"How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the bedroom door closed?","You can't have S-E-X, when you're taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!"
7084,Why the hell did you take her?,Because you two were having sex!
7085,"No, we weren't!",Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair. You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?
7086,"All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating.",Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this.
7087,"No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!","Hey, I gotta! Unless..."
7088,Unless what?,Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.
7089,What? Why?,"Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name."
7090,Your family name is Tribbiani.,You almost had me.
7091,"Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?",Uh-huh.
7092,How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?,"It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex."
7093,"Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's just stupid.","We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really bonding."
7094,"Oh, they see us! Oh, they, they look mad. Oh, they figured it out. They're coming this way. Run!",Where?
7095,,Can you believe they're still not here?
7096,"I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the chances?","I know, I'm so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?"
7097,What?,We've been stood up. And we want our free crab cakes.
7098,"Guys, guys, I've got great news! Guess what.","Uh, ah, Monica's pregnant?!"
7099,"Actually, it pays nothing. It's an internship.","Oh, that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'."
7100,,Hey!
7101,Hey!,Where's Chandler? I wanna wish him good luck on his first day. ... and I smelled bacon.
7102,He just left.,Who did?
7103,Joey! You never gonna believe it: she called.,She did?
7104,You got it!,I did?
7105,What is she talking about?,"I don't know, but it sounds great."
7106,Your agent called. You got that audition.,With Lennart Haze?
7107,Yes.,"Oh my god, that is great! That is *** for a play on broadway... and in a real theatre, not that little one underneath the dally like last time."
7108,Is it a good play?,"Well, it must be, because I read and I didn't understand a singe word."
7109,"Yeah, and Lennart Haze is starring in it.","Yeah, yeah, and directing."
7110,"No, but... I saw the previews. They played it right before Jackass.",Ah!
7111,Ah!,"Yeah, he's done some amazing works."
7112,"Oh, yeah. Oh, I loved him in those cell phone commercials.",I know. When the monkey hits him in the face with that giant rubber phone.
7113,Hey! Maybe the monkey will be at the audition!,Don't make me more nervous than I already am!
7114,"This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.",It is so amazing to meet you. I'm such a big fan of your work.
7115,"Well, I've... I've been blessed with a... a lot of great roles.","""Tell me about it! """"Unlimited nights and weekends!"""""""
7116,"You making fun of me? Because I am not a sell-out. I didn't do that for the money, I believe in those phones. I almost lost a cousin because of bad wireless service.","No, I-I-I wasn't making fun of you, honestly, I-I think you were great in those commercials."
7117,Really?,Yeah.
7118,"Well, I do bring a certain credibility to the role.",Are you kiddin'? When they shoot you out of that cannon.
7119,"""Peeeeeooooooooch """"Hang up that phone!"""" One take!""",Wow!

7126,"Hey! I-I-I don't care if he's hot, you know. If you want to sleep with him, do it on your own time. This is a play. No, listen: if you insist on this, I will call my agent so fast on a cell phone that has a connection that is so clear he's gonna think I'm next door.","Ah, hi, ah. Thank you so much for whispering for my benefit, but, ah, look, if you just tell me what I did wrong, I'd just love to work on it and come back and try it again for you. And, and also: 'How you doing?' You should, please, just gimme another chance. I really wanna get better, please."
7127,"Well, if you wanna come back at the end of the day today, here are my notes. Ready?",Yeah.
7128,"Uhm, you're in your head. You-you're thinking way too much.",I really doubt that.
7129,"No, no, no. It's that you're not connected with anything in your body. There's no urgency. The scene is a struggle, uhm, it's a race. Also, what you did was horizontal. Don't be afraid to explore the vertical. And don't learn the words. Let the words learn you.",Couldn't I just sleep with the producer?
7130,"Hey, how did the audition go?","Well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, Lennart Haze did not like me."
7131,What happened?,"Well, he said I wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything I did was horizontal and I should be more vertical. Oh, and he said that I should think less."
7132,"Yes, but I don't think life experience with these.",Wooooooooow It's like they're on fire!
7133,They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.,I give you $ 500 for them!
7134,"No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for.","Hey, that'd work on me! Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords?"
7135,You're late!,"I know, I'm sorry, but can I just have a quick second to run to the bathroom?"
7136,"No, Lennart doesn't wait!",But I'm bursting with u-hu!
7137,Joey! Here we go. Let's go very quickly!,"Actually, I really need."
7138,"We must go now, quickly, please.",Yes... ahahaaa.

7144,"Yes. Plus... what you've got that... I don't know what you've got going... this squirmy quality that you bring into the character that I couldn't've even imagined. Wow, hey, here's what we gonna do: come back tomorrow for the final callbacks with the ***, do all of this what you've got going now, but you know what? more, more. Can you do that?","Sure, yeah. I don't have time to say thank you because I really gotta go."
7145,"Yes, how's this: They're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!",Hey!
7146,Hey!,Probably wanna know what I'm doing...?
7147,"No, that seems about right.","Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!"
7148,"Joey, that was formula.",We gotta get more of that.

7155,Hey Joey!,Hey!
7156,"Listen...I need to know that what I'm about to ask you, will never get back to Chandler.","I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself. Chandler is my best friend, it would be wrong. Good......But wrong."
7157,Ok first of all...It would be great. But that's not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money.,"Aww, I don't know Monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always a mistake."
7158,But Chandler lent you money!,And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.
7159,Come on...I just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.,Oh...how much?
7160,Two thousand dollars?,Two thousand dollars!? What do you think I am? I soap opera star!?
7161,Yeah...,That's right I am!
7162,Hi you guys!,Hey!
7163,Hey!,Oo...what's in the bag?

So I went to the store and got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment.","""Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know, when I was a kid it was like.. """"Whoops!

7166,"Yeah, Why? You don't think a woman can do this?","Oh, women can. You can't."
7167,Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!,The hardware store is right down the street.
7168,Hey Joe!,Hey!
7169,Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything about it.,I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.
7170,And that would have made the official party line. Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.,"Yeah, I know."
7171,What? What do you mean you know?,"Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working and the economy is bad."
7172,Oh! Right.,That's the fastest I have ever thought!
7173,"Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money.",Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?
7174,Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that!,Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your rent is.
7175,Oh ok.,I am on fire! Chandler : Listen...this is really nice. Do you... Did you write a cheque to Monica for two thousand dollars? Did Monica borrow money from you?
7176,I am on fire! Chandler : Listen...this is really nice. Do you... Did you write a cheque to Monica for two thousand dollars? Did Monica borrow money from you?,Err... Kind of.
7177,I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?,"Oh no no no no no... It wasn't... It wasn't because of your money problems, it was for something for her."
7178,What?,Something personal.
7179,Excuse me.,Boob job.
7180,I don't want her to get a boob job! That's crazy!,"Well it's...It's not that crazy okay? Making them smaller, that would be crazy."
7181,,Rach?! Rachel!!!!? So I can't do anything I like????
7182,Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?,Because she is!
7183,"Joey, Chandler knows I borrowed the money.",Mmmm hmm! For your boob job!
7184,It's over/Joe!,OK so I'm out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?
7185,You know sometimes your words... they hurt.,"Hey uh, where do you guys want this?"
7186,Right. Except that I do want to get married.,Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh?
7187,,AH HAH! I DID IT! HA HA! Alright... Better take all I can carry. Who knows when i'll be able to get in here again!
7188,"Oh yeah, let me just finish this.","Hey Ross, check this out! yeah, I can't do that!"
7189,"You know what? I'm gonna finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat.",Hey!
7190,"""Maybe we finish this for him! """"Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had""""... aaand SEND!""","No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him!"

7193,Hey! How was basketball?,"Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!"
7194,"Oh, no! Who did that?",Chandler... hey... Rach... what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma?
7195,"She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him. That's all right? Isn't it?","Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!"
7196,"Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!","Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount..."
7197,"All right... Oh, Emma loves him!",Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!
7198,,"Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel... with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. It's okay, Emma, you stay asleep."
7199,": Step away from the crib, I have a weapon!","It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy."
7200,What are you doing?,"Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy."
7201,"Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom.",There you go sweetie... This isn't over.
7202,,"Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend."
7203,"Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.","No, no, it's not a girl, it's... a brand new Hugsy!"
7204,"Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.","No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back."
7205,"Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail...",Make the transfer!
7206,Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?,"Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago."
7207,"Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.",But he's the same.
7208,"Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.",But he's the same.
7209,"Joey, come on!",He's the same! .
7210,He's the same! .,You're not the same!
7211,"I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?",Original or crappy?
7212,Original.,"No, sorry haven't seen him."
7213,Then what's that big lump under your covers?,"It's Monica, ok?"
7214,That's not Monica!,"Alright!! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him.."
7215,Oh God.,... she's being unreasonable!
7216,"Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much Oh don't cover its ears! It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!",It does?
7217,Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.,Really? She... she loves me?
7218,"Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever .","Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then... well she can have him."
7219,"Oooh... you're sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up. Look Emma, look who's baaack!",Look forget it forget it... I can't do it.
7220,Are you gonna... you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child?,How do you think I got him in the first place?
7221,,"Monica, hey, can I borrow the Porsche?"
7222,Ok.,Alright!
7223,But ehm...what is it not?,A place to entertain my lady friends.
7224,And what else is it not?,A place to eat spaghetti.
7225,Very good! What do you need it for anyway?,"Oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they don't sell tickets here in New York, so..."
7226,Oh! So you're driving up to Connecticut?,Yeah Connecticut...Not West Virginia.
7227,"Hey, maybe I'll drive you up there! I'd like to buy some tickets myself!",Uh!
7228,The woman just vanished!,"Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?"
7229,Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.,I like those odds!
7230,Kinda like Joey.,What's that now? Opening credits.
7231,They're towing a car. And I am seeing...spots.,Oh my god Ross! You don't have Emma! And Rachel you don't have Emma! Where's Emma? Who has Emma!?
7232,Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. You were there!,I was?
7233,Yes and you talked to her...,I did?
7234,She dropped off a casserole?,Oh yeah! The casserole lady.
7235,"Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.",Ooh! Tough odds!
7236,Yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery!,Look who's coming around!
7237,Damnit. Alright call me when you know more.,Did you get it?
7238,One of the slots got filled.,By you!?
7239,"Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands.",I'll do it!! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine.
7240,"Well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing for the same thing, right?",I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...you know...won't come true!
7241,"""Right! .. but we """"know"""" what you're wishing for!""",Can't really say!
7242,"I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?",I'm not really comfortable with these questions!
7243,"One, two, three!","I won, hey!"
7244,Ooh! Calm down ...,"Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it?"
7245,"""Oh, I'm sorry, did I say """"invest it""""? I meant """"be cool and piss it all away""""""","Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy the Knicks!"
7246,I don't really care about the Knicks.,"Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward."
7247,"You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.",You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believe you're taking this away from me!
7248,"Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody else hear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept with him!! .. Alright, bye.","Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?"
7249,3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that's important ...,"I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut, when did you even get those?"
7250,When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!,I'll show you how.
7251,"OH! Alright, you know what? That's it! I want my share of the tickets !","Yeah, I want my tickets too ! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!"
7252,"No, no! We should divide them up and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!","Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! This all thing was my idea!"
7253,"Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split them up!",Oh!
7254,"Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets.","No, no!"
7255,"Hi mum, put her back on!","""Rach, come on! They are announcing the numbers! My God, I can already feel myself changing. TV: """"Here we are, the official Powerball numbers! We have 53"""""""

7258,You bet! No TV or anything!,"Hey, that is so great about the job."
7259,"Thanks, man.",And I like to think I had a little something to do with it.
7260,Really? What?,"Well, before, with the wishbone... I didn't wish we would win the lottery, I wished you'd get the job."
7261,"Oh yeah? Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heart right out.",Oh yeah.
7262,Me too.,Me too.
7263,,"Hey guys, so I just called the Powerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won."
7264,,"God, you're beautiful...why are we fighting this?You know you want it to happen as much as I do. Joey: I want you.I need you.Let me make love to you."
7265,"I don't wanna stand in the way of true love or anything, but I think a cantaloupe might hurt less.","Oh, ehm...I'm...I'm rehearsing my lines.They gave me a big romantic story on Days Of Our Lives. It's the first time my character's got one. I'm so nervous, you know, I really want it to be good!"
7266,Woow!I haven't seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were gonna be with a real talking dog!,"Yeah, that was a disappointment... Oh, hey!D'you want to come down to the set and tell me if I'm doing ok?"
7267,Are you serious?,"Yeah!Hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again."
7268,"Hey, that was an honest mistake!","""Right!""""Oh my God, is this the men's room? Oh, I feel so foolish, have you always known you wanted to be an actor?"""""""
7269,"Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?","I don't know, but one of the extras sure did! Hey, listen Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!"
7270,"Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so gorgeous!",Also so gay!
7271,"""Oh, in my head he's done some pretty """"not-gay-stuff""""!""","Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely gay stuff!"
7272,"Joey, Joey! We're ready for you!","Oh, wish me luck!"
7273,"Ok, not that you need it but good...GOD!Is that Chase Lassiter?He's straight, right?","Rach, I gotta say...if you weren't here wondering if these guys were gay I don't know if I could do this!"
7274,Hi!,Hey!
7275,"Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking all day about that scene you did, I mean, you were amazing!","Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me!"
7276,"God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!","Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with me?"
7277,"Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress.","Oh, all right, I can ask Monica."
7278,"Oh screw her, that part is mine!","Right... ok, so just from the top of the page, right here."
7279,Kiss me.,What?
7280,Kiss me.,"Ah, Rach, it doesn't say that!"
7281,"No, I'm saying...","but, but.."
7282,Hey!,Hey!
7283,"Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?",Oh man! I thought I got it all!
7284,How...how...?,"I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?"
7285,uh-huh.,"And I couldn't find this little plastic thing that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very!"
7286,Wow...definitely just Drake...,What?
7287,What...how is it going with Drake?,Oh...I don't think it's going very well...
7288,What...that scene I saw was so good!,"Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow..."
7289,"Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?","A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia."
7290,So?,So...I've never played that!
7291,"Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?",Uh...well...just once...with you...
7292,Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?,What the hell are you talking about??
7293,"Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene.","Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me."
7294,"Joey, you never..you never talked about that before...","Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful... and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you but it was worth it just to be there looking at you. Joey: Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!! Closing credits."
7295,,"Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?"
7296,"Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.","Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play."

7299,What? How come that you don't have to go!,"I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want."

7307,You do that every year??,I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!
7308,"Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us??",Yeah...
7309,And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?,Yeah...
7310,"OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?",I can't believe you guys went for that one!
7311,"Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?","You're fine, ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!"
7312,"Well, then so you just invite me...!","Please, I was trying to be nice, you're the worst one!"

7323,"Why, why, what's wrong with these guys?","Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best."
7324,"Joey, you're so sweet.","That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight."
7325,What? Really?,"Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!"
7326,"Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it!",Gotcha.
7327,"Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was!",Hey!
7328,"So, a professor, uh?","Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious . That's not how she used it...?"

7338,And there is a collection of Walt Whitman letters on display at the public library.,"I know, yeah!"

7341,The museum!,I don't think so.
7342,,Ross!
7343,Hi!,I need to talk to you about Charlie.
7344,"Oh, do you, do you really?","Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem."
7345,"""Look, if you don't know what the word """"acrimonious"""" means, just don't use it!""","No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her body is soo..."
7346,Get to the problem!,Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!
7347,Are you wearing two belts?,"EH, what do you know!"
7348,You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.,"Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!"
7349,"You know, I really don't want to get involved in you guy's relationship.","Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her."
7350,Fine.,Thanks.
7351,"Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!",The Metsss!
7352,"Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.","Oh, that's what she meant! You know, if they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion!"
7353,"Yeah, most of it it's a place packed with confused angry baseball fans!","Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET."
7354,"Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture, you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.","Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!"
7355,But I'm not! . You know what if you're in the mood for Thai food...,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?"
7356,Ok.,You got to tell me exactly what to do there.
7357,"Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.","Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make the right."
7358,,Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.
7359,"Now, do you have any idea what you just said?","No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!"
7360,"Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.",Phonetically?
7361,"Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time for this.",Ok.
7362,"Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!","""Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on """"Days"""" I had to say """"Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy""""."""
7363,Wow. What does that mean?,"""No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means """"you're gonna get eaten by a bear""""."""
7364,Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?,"Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! ."
7365,"Nah ah! Nah ah! No no no! No ad-libbing and dude, you can't touch the paintings.",Come on! you...
7366,That was going to be my next argument.,Hey!
7367,Hey!,You're ready?
7368,"Yeah, let's go. Thanks Ross.","Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me up."
7369,Glad I could help man.,"Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna be, but... I made it work."
7370,"So, I have to go shopping today, which is my least favourite thing, I'm soo bad at picking out clothes!","So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good."
7371,"Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!",Oh hey Rach!
7372,Yeah...,Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.
7373,I'm sure you have better things to do.,"Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes."
7374,"Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!","Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... ... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY!"
7375,"Ok, great! All right, bye! Pain in the ass!! That's off, right?","What's the matter, Pheebs?"
7376,"Ok, that'll be great!","Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together."

7380,"We'll see you, guys!",Bye.
7381,Ok.,"All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?"
7382,"Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.",So you're ruling out surrogacy?
7383,Yeah.,"So, I don't have to learn what that means?"
7384,"Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.","Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?"
7385,I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.,"Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!"
7386,,Hello?
7387,"Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?",No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?

7390,Barbados.,"Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!"
7391,What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.,"Well, just wake him up!"
7392,"I can't! If he realizes that I'm the one that put him to sleep, I won't get the job!","Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?"
7393,,Wow! You look... ... stop-eating hot! Which is like the highest level of hotness!
7394,Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party.,Then don't go!
7395,"Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture.","Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!"
7396,,Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go!
7397,"Oh, that's right! Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. We're going to a conference in Barbados, right?",Mmh-mmh.

7402,"Doctor Geller, I'm such a huge fan!",That... never happens...
7403,Are you a paleontologist?,"""No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called """"The Days of Our Lives""""."""
7404,"""Dude, it's just """"Days of Our Lives""""... there's no the.""","Ok, Ross! It's... It's fun, yeah! No, I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray."
7405,"I'm sorry, I don't own a TV.",You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at??
7406,,Yeah! How you doin'? Yeah alright!
7407,Yeah! How you doin'? Yeah alright!,"Hey, hey! You said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong?"
7408,I didn't mean a thong... I meant thongs...,You really should have been more clear about that!
7409,Hey!,Hey!
7410,You're never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!,Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?
7411,Yeah... what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?,"""You could say: """"Hey Kenny, how come you're not Britney Spears?"""""""

7414,I will if you will.,Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!
7415,So you'll be ok?,"Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming..."
7416,"Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?","No, why?"

7426,I can't believe this. I can't believe this is happening. I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! Ok? I have to stand up in front of all these people. What am I gonna say?,I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.
7427,"Oh wait, Joey and I are supposed to have dinner .","Hey don't worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can."
7428,"Alright, ok, let's do it. Uhm, I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm, and then, then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era, the breakup of Pangea, hello! And then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the Triassic.","""Oh, oh! Any chance any of this happened in a """"Galaxy far, far away""""? ."""

7435,And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.,In that case should I make sure it's on real good?

7437,"I know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home.","Not enough pills in the world, Rach. What about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like?"
7438,"Well, let's see. There was a really big guy that I was talking to, with the really nice breasts...","But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like?"

7453,"Oh, thank you so much!","Yeah, and so funny!"
7454,Hey! There you are!,"Hey! As soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! Some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya!"
7455,"I'm sorry, I can't! I'm running a discussion group all afternoon.","Oh... oh, but that's ok, I'll find someone else to do it... I'll do it alone, but... I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you..."
7456,You know... I feel so bad! I haven't seen you this whole trip and especially last night...,"Hey! Don't worry about it! It was fine! I ended up having the best time with Rachel! I just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on Ross's speech..."

7467,"W-What are you, what are you talking about?","Oh, c'mon, I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie, and it's like... What the hell is my problem? OH!"
7468,Ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl...,"I'm telling you, Rach, Charlie is not right for me!"
7469,"Yeah, I'm not talking about her...",But then who? The waitress I went out with last month?
7470,You know? Forget it!,"No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?"
7471,"No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know who I'm talking about! So!","Ok! All right, well... I'm gonna see if I can get a room for the night and I'll... I'll see you later!"
7472,,You like me?
7473,"Ok, let's not make a big thing about this!",That's a huge thing!
7474,"Not working with me, Joe! Here's the thing: lately I have been having thoughts musings, if you will!",What... for how long?
7475,Only like a month!,A MONTH??
7476,"What the... DIAL IT DOWN! Listen, ok, and maybe they're crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do, I have, I've been thinking about... you know, us! Ok, dial it up a little!",I just have one question!
7477,Shoot!,What the hell are you doin'???
7478,"I don't know, I'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know... I mean, aren't you just a... little curious... what that would be like?...","Uh, am I curious? I mean, I am as curious as... as... George!!"
7479,Who...?,"CURIOUS GEORGE ! You know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!"
7480,"Oh yes, of course, I remember him!","Yeah, he had a paper route."
7481,"Yeah, he did! Oh, see, this is what I'm talking about!","No, I know, yeah I know we're great but Rach no... this... this can't happen!"
7482,But can it... just... happen a little bit?,"NO, NO! It can't happen at all!"
7483,"But why, why not?","Because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok? I have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did I ever say no! I couldn't do it to Ross!"
7484,But that wasn't gonna stop you before!,"I know, I know! But I've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right... I'm sorry...!"
7485,"I'm sorry, too! OH GOD! I shouldn't have said anything!","NO! No-no-no-no-no-no! Hey! Hey, we'll be fine! Li... hey, like you said: no big deal!"
7486,It's not a big deal!,NO BIG DEAL!
7487,It's so not a big deal!,Yeah! I'll see ya later! Yeah!
7488,Ooh... I love Barbados!,Ooh... I can't believe I'm kissing you. I'm kissing Rachel!
7489,"Hey, you know, before you said that nothing could happen between us? What changed?","Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then I saw him kissing Charlie..."
7490,"Rach, you there?","Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we gonna do?"
7491,"Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant. That's not nonchalant!",No idea what it means.
7492,"Yeah, sure...",I don't believe this... Have you guys been...
7493,Joey!,Is he gone?
7494,How are you doing this?,Pssst...
7495,Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated this could get? What about Ross?,"Well, he's with Charlie now."
7496,"Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?","You're a pain in my ass, Geller!"
7497,Are they right?,"Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to Ross."
7498,"Yeah... Yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight.","Yeah, I think that'd be best... So, so I'm gonna... I'm gonna take off..."
7499,Although...,I like although!
7500,"I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like... six years...",Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool...
7501,"Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.",Absolutely! He's not thinking about you.
7502,No...,I'm thinking about you...
7503,Yeah...,Let's forget about Ross...
7504,Forgotten.,What's wrong?
7505,"Sorry, I just uhm... I can't seem to get Ross out of my head...","Well, maybe I can help."
7506,"Ooh, your lips are so soft... Do that again...",Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...
7507,,"Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up."
7508,"Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.","Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?"
7509,"Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference with Charlie.",I understand...
7510,Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.,I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.
7511,"Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner.",Ooh...
7512,Still nervous?,I'm gonna get the lasagna.
7513,Hey!,Hey!
7514,"So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.",Yeah?
7515,"Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and..., well...",You kissed.
7516,Wha... What? What would give you that idea?,I saw you.
7517,"Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay.","Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay."
7518,What?,"It's okay. You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And... I want you to be happy."
7519,Are you serious?,Yeah... Now I have something...
7520,"I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that?",Oh... uh... look... before you...
7521,"No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous...","I am those things, yeah."
7522,"You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some stuff...",Dude!
7523,"Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...",I can't think of anything.
7524,Thanks!,Yeah.
7525,"Excuse me! You didn't tell him, did you?",I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.
7526,"Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.","Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that."
7527,,Hey!
7528,Hi!,"So, did you err... did you tell Ross?"
7529,"Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again.","No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory."
7530,"Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.","Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together."
7531,"Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can't...","I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals."
7532,"No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that means good night then?",Yeah! Good night!
7533,Goo--ood night!,Good night!
7534,"Seriously, good night!",Stop saying good night.
7535,,"Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. Let me explain, okay?"
7536,We weren't doing anything!,"Rach, he just saw us."
7537,Shhh.,"But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss."
7538,"No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.","Dude, chill! Okay, we also kissed in Barbados, but we didn't plan it, okay? And the only reason that that happened was because I saw you kissing Charlie."
7539,"Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill.","Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but.."
7540,"We feel so terrible about this, Ross.","Yeah, but it did happen, so..."
7541,"Yeah, but it did happen, so...",Ross?
7542,So you two are..?,Yeah.
7543,And have you .. ed?,"No, no, no!"
7544,"But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?",Probably.
7545,Probably.,"No, no!"
7546,"Hey, hey, hey... If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you. I'm fine!",Really?
7547,"Absolutely. I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really, I'm fine. I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing. I mean, at first I was like.. But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin' this.",Ross..
7548,"No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!!","Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?"
7549,"Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!!",I do like fajitas.
7550,,"Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date."
7551,"Well, what would we be doing?","I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home..."
7552,Feel me up?,In a carriage!
7553,In a carriage!,"Hey, Charlie!"
7554,"Oh, you bet.","So, did you bring a little something for Ross?"
7555,Actually.. It's stuff you left at my apartment.,"Oh. Oh, thanks."
7556,"And you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you want.","Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out.."
7557,Oh! That is so thoughtful. She's a keeper. And what did you bring me?,"Uh, actually, that's.."
7558,What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? You see? Who else is fine?,"Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink."
7559,"Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin'.","Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?"
7560,"""O is for """"oh, wow!"""" The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own.""","Dude, are you okay?"
7561,I don't even know what that's for.,You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.
7562,"Yeah, that's probably a good idea.",Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.
7563,"Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this.","It doesn't look good, does it?"
7564,,Morning. Here you go.
7565,Thanks. Did you stay here all night?,Yeah.
7566,So you took off my pants and shoes?,"No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen."
7567,What do you mean?,"Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly.."
7568,"Hey, what are you talking about? I'm fine!","It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel."
7569,"Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?","That's what I hear, yeah."
7570,"This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is this thing with you and Rachel?","Come on, I mean, you know me, you know..."
7571,Joey.,I'm crazy about her.
7572,And she feels the same way?,I think so.
7573,"Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.","Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it."
7574,"No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?","No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this?"
7575,"Yeah, I'm sure.",And we're okay?
7576,"So, you and Rachel tonight, huh?",Yeah. It's actually our first official date.
7577,Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?,"Naa, no. This is the part I'm actually good at."
7578,What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.,It's OK!
7579,How can you be so confident?,"Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!"
7580,Really? Like you have a routine?,"No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have to appreciate their uniqueness."
7581,Really?,"No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes. Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh."
7582,You mean like this?,"NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this."
7583,"Oh, I see what you mean, that's quite nice.",More foosball?
7584,Thanks for dinner.,"I thought you paid. Ha, guess we won't be going back there!"
7585,So.,Yeah.
7586,Yeah.,"Hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of the couch?"
7587,"I say 'cheesy line', but ok.",What's the matter?
7588,"I am sorry, I don't know, I am sorry, I don't know why I did that!",Okay.
7589,"I am sorry! Again... I don't know, I don't know what happened, I must be nervous!","I don't get it, Chandler loved it!"
7590,"Ok, ok, ok. I promise, I promise, I promise, I won't do it again. I really do. I promise. This is gonna be great.",Ok.
7591,Ok.,"Uh, was that good for you?"
7592,,"Rach, you sure you wanna do this?"
7593,"Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... it's just a little weird, it's you, and it's me, it's just gonna take some getting used to.","Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier?"
7594,"Ok, let's work from the top down! Just work the bra, Joe!","Ok, yeah, got it."
7595,"Ok, yeah, got it.",Okay.
7596,Okay.,This thing welded shut?!
7597,Okay.,"All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this thing."
7598,Ow!,Sorry!
7599,Well this is romantic!,"I'm sorry! This never happened to me before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open! I blame your bra!"
7600,It's a standard issue bra clasp!,Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me off with all your slapping!
7601,"Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey, but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take off my bra?",NAH! I don't have another level!!
7602,"Ok, that's true. That's true, we can do this. You're right, you're right, we can do this. We're just gonna power through!",Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second .
7603,,Hey!
7604,Hey! Got champagne?,"Yes ma'am, ready to Power through!"
7605,"Excellent! Stick it in the ice bucket, the phone is off the hook, and in the interest of powering through ...",Uh!
7606,"Ok Sexy, sexy, very sexy, sexy. Alright! Lets do it!","Ok, you're scaring me a little bit."
7607,"Oh! Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this! Ok. Aha! You like that huh?",Oh! yeah!
7608,You like that? Let's take this into high gear.,uh uh!
7609,"Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!","No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!"
7610,What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?,Soldier down!
7611,What is the matter with us?,"Well, I know what's the matter with me."
7612,"No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?",I don't know.
7613,"No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...","Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?"
7614,"Well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.","Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit."
7615,"Right, totally.","Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it."
7616,"Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples that never have sex.",That's a... pla-an.
7617,That's a... pla-an.,Wow... I did not see this coming.
7618,I know.,"I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what I wanted."
7619,I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?,I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.
7620,Aah... I bet you're right.,So...
7621,Yeah.,I love ya.
7622,"Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.","Yeah, me too."

7631,"Joey, it's a birthday party.","""Yeah, but for a one-year-old. What's the point... the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup. Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it dressed as a farmer. And he's standing next to this cow and the cow says """"El-moo""""! Yeah... that's a funny cup!"""
7632,There's something you didn't know about your dad!,Hey Mr. and Mrs. Geller! Let me help you with that.

7634,I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!,"Hey Pheebs, you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song, maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents!"
7635,So you're gonna... hit on her?,"No, no, no! My talents as an actor!"
7636,Oh!,"You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one of her books!"
7637,Or you could stick a fork in an apple!,"Hey, I think Emma might like it!"
7638,Oh! Emma might like what?,"Um, my present!"
7639,What did you get her?,Actually we prepared performances.
7640,Separate performances.,But equally real!
7641,"Sure, yeah!",O K.
7642,Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared?,"Hey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting!"

7653,Nighty-night!,"Bye, bye."
7654,Joey? How could you just let them leave?,"Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm not gonna mess with Jack, he's a great man, he fought for our country."

7660,The one I told you about last week?,What? You never said anything about an audition!

7662,No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.,"Oh! I got it! Ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. Alright? Whoever gets the highest number gets to go first."
7663,"Ok, ten.","Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else?"
7664,"No, lets just draw straws.","Or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the.."
7665,I'm begging you stop.,Right.
7666,"Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go from here to here. Now the one who comes in last, stays!","Ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys!"

7668,I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?,Way to go robot!
7669,Good job Alan!,"Hey, good race you guys."
7670,"I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something, you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright.","Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE TIME!"
7671,"Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE TIME!",I've been here the whole time!
7672,"Hey, you made it into a bunny.",What is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it was a penis.
7673,"You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her first cookie.",Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time!
7674,I've never given her a cookie. Have you?,"No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from a can!"
7675,Thank you!,"U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight."
7676,"""Yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much """"with the words"""".""",Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!
7677,Clearly we were wrong.,"I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? And I know how much you wanna have a baby, you know, and I would love to help you get one."

7682,You're not good!,Always nice to meet a fan!
7683,Oh my God!,"I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated."
7684,What... what you working on?,"Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so..."
7685,Why don't you use your Thesaurus?,What did I just say?
7686,"Watch. Here, you ehm... You highlight the word you want to change. Go under Tools and the Thesaurus generates... 'gives'... 'gives' a whole list of choices. You can pick the word that sounds smartest.","""Oh my God, that's great! I'm smart!! No, no, I'm... """"brainy, bright, clever"""", I love this thing! Look out ladies, Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package!!"""
7687,,"Hey, finished my recommendation. Here. And I think you'll be very, very happy. It's the longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn."
7688,I don't... uh... understand.,Some of the words are a little too sophisticated for ya?
7689,It doesn't make any sense.,Of course it does! It's smart! I used the the-saurus!
7690,On every word?,Yep!
7691,"Alright, what was this sentence originally?","Oh, 'They are warm, nice, people with big hearts'."
7692,And that became 'they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?,"Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude."
7693,"Hey Joey, I don't think we can use this.",Why not?
7694,But Erin Brockovich had her own house.,"Ah, look who's back! Why do you have bags? RACH, WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS?"
7695,"Well, I'm staying with you guys!",What?
7696,,You slept out here?
7697,"Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling 'Myron, get off!'","But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me we're getting rid of her."
7698,"Joey, I can't do that!","""Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said """"Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!"""" I don't need that kind of talk in my house!"""
7699,"Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she's difficult, but I think it's really good that she's here.",'Cause we will appreciate it more when she's gone?
7700,"No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of me.","Yeah, Monica made us!"
7701,Good morning.,Yeaah.
7702,"Oh, I can't, honey. I'm gonna go get my eyebrows shaped. I am not happy. Oh... sure you wanna eat that?","I'M CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!"
7703,Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?,"Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency."
7704,You dropped it off?,Yeah.
7705,Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?,"No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to hand-write it."
7706,You hand-wrote it?,"Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at all! See ya later!"
7707,,"Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani... Oh, hi! Well, I'm glad you liked my letter... No my mommy and daddy aren't home right now... Okay, bye bye. She was nice!"
7708,"Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!",Whoo-hoo!
7709,"Joey, where are those bags?",She has a lot of crap!
7710,My God!,Hey!
7711,"Well, it was really sweet, and like the most romantic thing ever.","Well, hey! Well... Here's to Phoebe, who's found the greatest guy in the world! To Phoebe and... I wanna say Mike? To Phoebe and Mike!"
7712,Hey honey!,Hi sweetie!
7713,Is Monica not here?,No.
7714,"Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!",Cool!
7715,"Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas were mine! Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were mine!!!","That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it?"
7716,"Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're right for the part.","What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon! Huh? I'm old! I'm tired! Hey, I'm hot I'm cold!! Huh?? Come on! What can't I do?"
7717,"First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.","""I can do that! """"Hello, I'm your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing. I like to use..."""" Oh, what's the product?"""
7718,Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?,I'm cold!
7719,Hi!,Oh! Any word on casting yet?
7720,"Joe, I told you, you're just not right for the part.","What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?"
7721,"I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna be interested in.","Look, c'mon, please? It's not like I'm asking for some crazy favour. This is what I do for a living. I am a professional actor! Oh, man, I'm two hours late for work! . Look, here's a copy of my reels. It's got all the commercials that I've been in."
7722,Joe...,"Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't pass it on to your bosses!"
7723,Fine!,Thank you.
7724,"Work, Joe!",Damn it!
7725,What am I gonna do now?,Just pass it to your boss!
7726,Hey Joe!,What's up?
7727,Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.,Oh.
7728,I'm sorry man.,"But, ehm... you watched the tape?"
7729,"Yeah! I... I... I liked it! But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches!",You didn't watch the tape.
7730,What!? Of course I did!,"Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?"
7731,"I'm not lying to you, I watched it!","Well, you lied again!"
7732,I watched it!,Keep going Pinocchio!
7733,I did!,No you didn't!
7734,What did I just say?,You still here?
7735,"Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...","Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok? First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying about... lying... Stop lying!"
7736,Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?,You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why?
7737,"Well, this is going well.","Here's how I know you didn't watch the tape, ok? If you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan."
7738,"Here's how I know you didn't watch the tape, ok? If you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan.",And that's how I know you didn't watch the tape! .
7739,O-oh my God!,What?
7740,"Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?",I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very reasonable price.
7741,"Joey, we're not keeping this!",But it's an original Buffay...
7742,"Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't mind that she's haunted.",Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?
7743,"She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob.",GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!
7744,"Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part or not.",That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you lied.
7745,Excellent!,"Now, what do you say?"
7746,Lying is wrong!,And?... AND?
7747,,Gladys?
7748,"Ha ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does not get old.",You're mean!
7749,,Hey!
7750,Hey!,What's going on?
7751,You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!,"Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?"
7752,"And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.","Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity."
7753,Little people?,Celebrity.
7754,It isn't mine!,"Well, I guess we'll never know whose it is!"
7755,"Well, I'm sorry I brought it up. So, are either one of you planning on staying at home with your child...",Hellooo? Anybody in there order a celebrity? OW!
7756,,"Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe..."
7757,"Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls.",Guys!?
7758,Keep on roaming Bert! We don't want any crazy today!,What's going on?
7759,"WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!",Everything doesn't sound fine!
7760,She's putting words in your mouth!,"Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!"
7761,"Hey! Hey, guess what Joey has!",Three tickets to today's Rangers game!!

7763,Oh my God!,"Yeah, they're great seats too!"
7764,Guess where they are?,Center ice.
7765,"Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back.","So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time."
7766,"You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.","Dude, two times that happened!"
7767,"He's right, man.","Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four."
7768,Okay. And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!,"That's some gentle comedy, dude."
7769,"We're still going at the game, right?",Yeah!
7770,,"Oh, Bob, get off the guy!"
7771,"Oh! What a game, huh?","I know, yeah."
7772,I can't believe Chandler is missing this!,"Yeah. I am sorry he's not here too, but I got to say, I am really enjoying Nacho Chair."
7773,"Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away.",Ohhhh! These seats are great!
7774,"I know, I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner!","Wow, hey, we'd better get going. If we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner."
7775,"Oh, but it's a kind game! So we're a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for one more goal.",I don't know...
7776,One more fight!,Okay.
7777,,How late are we?
7778,Forty-five minutes.,Wow.
7779,Here!,"Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were!"
7780,You may want to lose the foam finger!,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!"
7781,Oh!,You are not at Thanksgiving?
7782,We're late too!,We figured we could be late because you guys were gonna be on time.
7783,"So, nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us!","Yeah, where were you!"
7784,And it looks like she put makeup on her!,"Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before..."
7785,So this is an annual thing?,Oh! That's Alicia Mae Emory's outfit!
7786,"Well, I don't know, you guys figure it out, I got to put Emma down for a nap.","All right. Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia Mae."
7787,"Oh, good, that's good, but you don't look like you were mugged!",No. Here.
7788,We know you're out there.,Who do you think its from?
7789,"Well, I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.","I hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning."
7790,"Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first. Ready? .",Ah-haah! I win!!
7791,What is that?,That's fire. Beats everything.
7792,"Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon? .","Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played."
7793,"You guys, come on, it doesn't matter why we're late. We're all here now, please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey.",I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that.
7794,How are we gonna decide who gets this?,WATER BALLOON!
7795,"You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together.","Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us."
7796,I don't know...,I'm telling ya... I can do it.
7797,Oh!,"Oh! It all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing..."
7798,Oh! Enough! A monkey could have made 'em!,"Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible."
7799,"He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him!","Come on you guys, we want you to know we're very very sorry. Right guys?"
7800,"So, so sorry.","Now let's not ruin this day. You worked so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?"
7801,"Well, you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.",Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness!
7802,It's a day to be thankful.,Don't make me come up there!
7803,It's too late for apologies.,Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner.
7804,"Ewww, is that what that is?",Sorry!

7809,"Joey, that is not gonna work.",No seriously... I'm really wedged in here.
7810,Okay.,aaw-ahhh-aaahhh STOP! STOP! I'm worried about damaging my head.
7811,A little late for that.,"Alright, hurry up, you gotta do something."
7812,Bring it.,I just wanna say that I'm sorry I referred to the vein as a seperate person...
7813,Here you go!,"Oh, that smells good!"
7814,"Oh, that smells good!",Okay.
7815,"Okay, try it.",It isn't working.
7816,"Alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain.","Well hurry, I can't feel my ears!"
7817,Can you ever feel your ears?,Interesting...
7818,I gave them to Joey.,I left them at the park.
7819,"Okay, I have to get that. Now when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The Vein has spoken.",It's really starting to hurt.

7823,"I can't believe they called, and we're actually getting a baby.","Oh, I know how you feel..."
7824,Really?,"""Sure. I went through the exact same thing with Alicia Mae Emory... The waiting, the wandering... Then one day... I get that call from Toys """"R"""" Us... She was in stock!"""
7825,"Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.","I can't believe it. When you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! That is so weird!"
7826,I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.,"But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys?"
7827,"Hey, who's Phoebe with?",I'm gonna say someone I'm gonna have sex with. Hey!
7828,Hey!,So... who's your friend?
7829,"Oh, that's Sarah. No, no. Don't you get any ideas, ok? No, I'm not setting you up with any more of my friends!","OW, why, why, why?"
7830,"Because you'll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists!","Oh, name one friend of yours that I did that with."
7831,Mandy.,"Mandy, uh? Uh... really hot blonde, big boobs?"
7832,No.,"I know why I don't remember her, huh?"
7833,Do you think I'm someone else?,"Ok, I may not have treated your friends well in the past, but I have grown up a lot, really. Honest, Rach?"
7834,"Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!",Growth!
7835,"Fine, I'll give you her number.","Ok, thank you. And I promise you I will not forget this one. Mandy."

7843,"That's it? That's why you won't go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal!","Hey, hey, look! It's not about a few fries... it's about what the fries represent."
7844,What?,ALL FOOD!
7845,"I'm sorry, I can't believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!","Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just don't order a Garden salad and then eat my food! That's a good way to lose some fingers!"
7846,Oh no! Not me! Emma!,JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD!
7847,"Well, I still think that it's a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!","I like that! A sharing buffer! Yeah! I'll order some extra fries! Maybe a plate of onion rings. Yeah. And a shrimp cocktail. And some buffalo wings. Maybe an individual pizza, uh? And some mozzarella sticks.

7858,What? what is the matter with you?,"I don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay?"
7859,"""But you just said """"What's mine is yours""""?""","WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT!"
7860,"Fine, I'm sorry, I didn't think it was that big a deal.","I'm sorry, I'm overreacting. Okay, It's just when it comes to food, I have certain rules, okay, I mean There are things you do..and you now, things.. that you don't do ."

7948,"Yeah. Well, uhm... listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he'd come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and... uhm... well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till Monday.",So he can't come?
7949,"No, and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, I would just really love it if you would do it.",Seriously?
7950,"Yeah, you've... you know, sort of been like a dad to me. I mean, you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom...",I am pretty wisdomous.
7951,So... what do you say?,"Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honored."
7952,"Oh, thank you. I hope... I hope you know how much you mean to me.","Listen, I hope... that you know... I don't want you to see your father cry, GO TO YOUR ROOM!"
7953,Oh.,"Oh no, no, no, let your dad get this."

7957,Who in God's name are you?,"Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!"
7958,,"So, you know I'm filling in for Phoebe's step dad, tomorrow, right?"
7959,"Yeah, yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that.","Oh, hey, my pleasure. So what are your intentions with my Phoebe?"
7960,I intend to marry her.,"Oh, a wiseacre. . No, no, no, I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano? Isn't that kind of unstable?"
7961,No more so than acting.,Strike two!
7962,"You're right. She probably will support me. Hey, unless we move in with you, dad?","Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!"
7963,"Ok-dokey, Joey, listen. This is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right? We're gonna have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.","Oh, man! I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was going to be corsages!"
7964,Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!,Hello Michael.
7965,Joseph.,"May I have a word with you, please?"
7966,This is... great...,"Have a seat. Last night, I tried to welcome you into my family... and instead, you disrespect me... I cannot allow this."
7967,Are you rehearsing for some really bad mafia movie?,"""More back talk. And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for """"Family Honor 2: Thissa Time Itsa Personal."""""""
7968,"Joey, I kinda have a lot to do today, what do you want?","I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me, ok? And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her."
7969,"Joe, I love Phoebe. She's the single most important thing in my life. I'd die before I let anything happen to her.","That's what I wanted to hear! Because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family."
7970,That must have been one lousy movie.,That was ME!
7971,"No! We're gonna do it my way. Because your way is stupid! Alright I gotta go, I have another call, Reverend. Hello?",I'm glad we had this little talk.
7972,"Oh my God, everything is such a mess. Why is this happening to me?",How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that?
7973,"Ok people, we are back in business! Oh God, we've missed you soo much! Ok, go and get your hair and make-up done, and I'll take care of everything.","Hey, what are you guys gonna do?"
7974,About what?,"The blizzard. I just saw on the news, it's like the worst snow storm in 20 years! They already closed all the bridges and tunnels."
7975,Ooh! But the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from New Jersey!,I don't think they are.
7976,"Well, the club lost it's power.","Yeah according to the news, most of the city did."
7977,Since when do you watch the news?,"Uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl."
7978,"Oh, no!","Oh hey, don't worry. I'm still ordained from your wedding."
7979,Really?,"Yeah, you'd think I'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? Huhuh..."
7980,"Uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free.","I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do."
7981,Na-ah.,"Friends, family, dog... Thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event. The cold has now spread to my special place... so I'm gonna do the short version of this.

8018,"Really, can I hear some of it.","""Sure, sure. Ok, """"Bleu de la bleu, de la blu bla bleu"""" See?"""
8019,"Well, you're not, You're not... you're not... again, you're not SPEAKING FRENCH!","Oh well I think I am, yeah and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part."
8020,How could you possibly think that?,"For one thing, the guy on the tape said I was doing a good job!"
8021,Whenever you're ready Joey.,"Right. Dja bu bu Claude. Uh, c'est la pu les la lu blah bloo."

8024,You really think this man is speaking French?,Sa-sa-saw!
8025,"Good job, little buddy. That was some really good French. But I think we're gonna go with someone else for the part.",Ah. All right. But my French was good?
8026,It was great.,Oh-hoh! Ha-hah! See!
8027,Merci. Au revoir.,Yeah-hah. Toute-de-le-fruit.
8028,"Okay, can you really tapdance?",No.
8029,Archery?,No.
8030,Horseback riding?,Would fall off a lot.
8031,You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?,That I can do.
8032,Come on! You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?,"All right, watch me! Okay, you time me. Ready?"
8033,Ooh!,Guess what? I finally got that seed out of my teeth.
8034,"What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? Ooh, I like it.",Hey guys.
8035,Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?,"No, thank you."
8036,"Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city.","But no, it's not close. You said it was in escrow? I couldn't even find it on the map."
8037,"Joey, please come. It would mean so much to us.","You know what? You are my friends, I wanna be supportive, I will come with you. SHOTGUN!"
8038,Good for you. That was really mature.,"What? No, the only reason I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm gonna make them stay here."
8039,"All right, prude... Look, Monica and Chandler really love this house. You are not gonna talk them into staying here.","""Hey, hey... I can convince people to do anything, you know. I bet I can even get Mike to do that """"thing"""". What is it?"""
8040,"""Hey, hey... I can convince people to do anything, you know. I bet I can even get Mike to do that """"thing"""". What is it?""",I AM NOT GONNA HELP YOU DO THAT! Goodbye!
8041,"Ah, so glad you decided to come.","Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus."
8042,What?,Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.
8043,No it's not. We had an inspection and they didn't find anything.,Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.
8044,Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.,"Maybe. So this is the living room huh? Ooh, it's pretty dark."
8045,No it's not!,Are you kiddin'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner!
8046,"When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?","Maybe. Well, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? Or any other house for that matter."
8047,"Oh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here.","FINE, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay? I just hope you get used to that weird humming sound. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm..."
8048,"Joey, we know that's you.",no... hmmmmm... it's not... hmmmmmmmmmm.
8049,,Ow!
8050,Who are you?,"Oh, hi, I'm Joey. My stupid friends are buying this house. Who are you?"
8051,I'm Mackenzie. My stupid parents are selling this house.,Oh.
8052,I hate my parents.,"I hate my friends. Alright, look. There's gotta be a way that we can stop this from happening."
8053,Like what?,"Uhm... oh! Okay. You come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!"
8054,What are you? Eight?,"Woah, uh! Okay, let's hear your great idea."
8055,I don't have any great ideas. I am eight.,"Ahh! There's gotta be a way. I mean, you know, if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike. That just leaves me and Ross and Rach, you know what I mean?"
8056,I really don't.,"What am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends."
8057,My parents say I'm gonna make new friends.,"Oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you're young. Me, I'm set in my ways."
8058,"This is what my mom was talking about. Whiners are wieners. Look, you want your friends to be happy, right?","Yeah, yeah, I guess."
8059,"Well, if moving here is gonna make them happy, don't you want them to do it?","Yeah, maybe."
8060,Then you gotta let them go.,"I hate to admit it, but you're probably right. How did you get to be so smart?"
8061,I read a lot.,Just when I thought we could be friends.
8062,"Man, those two dogs are going at it!",Hey!
8063,"Hey, where have you been?","Oh, just er... you know, looking around. But you know what? This house... is great."
8064,Really? What changed your mind?,"Oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing."
8065,"Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.",What?
8066,Ha! I'm just messing with you.,That's not funny! You know I'm afraid of little girl ghosts!
8067,"Joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?",What? I get my own room?
8068,You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?,"Oh my God! Oh! Hey, can I have an aquarium? And a sex swing?"
8069,No!,Why not? I'll keep the tank clean.
8070,,"I mean, this soap opera is a great gig, but... am I missing opportunities? You know, I've always thought of myself as a serious actor. I mean, should I be trying to do more independent movies?"
8071,I don't know... You know what? I'm gonna put you on with my bear. Hold on.,"Hey bear, I need some career advice."
8072,I got a really incredible job offer.,"Hey, great! All right!"
8073,It's in Paris.,"What? No, no, no! No, no... no... no, no... No, too much is changing, okay? First, Phoebe getting married Congratulations! ... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs..."
8074,"Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive...","Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it."
8075,Of course we can. Congratulations. Yay! Joey...,"No, no, no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA."
8076,"Joey, it would mean so...",Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me.
8077,,Hey Phoebe.
8078,Hey. Everything ok?,I'm just mad at my agent.
8079,Estelle? Why?,There's a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I didn't even be put up for it! She'd better have a good reason.
8080,I'm guessing she does.,"Well I'm wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this."
8081,"Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her.",Ok. Why?
8082,Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.,I love that saying! .
8083,I love that saying! .,Hello?
8084,"Joey, it's Estelle.",I was just gonna call you! That's weird.
8085,"It's a little coincidental, but believable. . Listen, I'm sure you're wondering why I didn't get you an audition for that TV movie.","Yeah, actually I am!"
8086,I guess I dropped the ball there. Whoopsie!,"That's it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball."
8087,"Don't take that tone with me. Who you think you are? Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?","No, no, look. All I'm saying is that you're my agent, ok? And you're not getting me into any auditions and I'm tired of it."
8088,What are you saying?,"I'm saying that... . This isn't working for me anymore, ok? Estelle, you're fired. Goodbye. ."
8089,"Hey Joey, want come with me to... are you ok?","Yeah, I just... I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be killing her."
8090,"No, that wouldn't kill her. Ordinary embolism might.","I don't know. She's got to be taking it hard, I was like her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I'm guessing he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she's not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years. I'm gonna call her and hire her again."
8091,"No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call you.",Why?
8092,Because patience is the road to understanding which ... is the key... to a happy heart.,You blow me away.
8093,"All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?","I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason."
8094,"Joey, this is Al T. Booker, the guy who eats paper. I'm sure you've heard that Estelle passed away. I wanted to let you know there's a memorial for her at the Westside chapel, tomorrow at ten. Hope you can make it.",Oh my God. Hello?
8095,"Joey, it's Estelle.",Estelle?
8096,"Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for firing me.","Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you're calling me?"
8097,"Well, I didn't think I should just drop by...","No, no, no! Don't drop by, don't drop by!"
8098,"Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay.","Can I ask you something? Uhm, what's it like there?"
8099,"It's alright. Look kiddo, I gotta go. Good luck with the career. You're gonna be huge.","""Thanks for everything Estelle. Bye. """"out of area"""". Boy, I'll say."""
8100,,"Thank you all for coming. We're here today to pay respects to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman... ..inside. As Estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words. Dude, where's my speech? That is entertaining. Al Zebooker everybody."
8101,,"All right, all right, all right, let's play one more time, ok? And remember, if I win you do not move to Paris."
8102,"Ok! Can't believe I'm risking this again, but you're on! All right Joe, you remember the rules! Heads I win, tails you lose.",Just flip!
8103,"Ha, tails!",Damnit!
8104,Hey!,Hey!
8105,What are you guys doing?,"Try it, I can't feel a thing!"
8106,"No, no, no, guys. She's right. We should get to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet, Joey you pack 'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.",You guys hear a ringing?
8107,What the hell is this?,"Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice! I didn't know you guys had it in ya!"
8108,I didn't know Monica had these!,"Mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard!"
8109,"Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that I don't want to move to the new house with me! So, enjoy: smoke oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust, kidney beans in their own juices, and for dessert, a questionable orange.",Hey.
8110,"Hey, where's Rach?","Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second."
8111,Great.,"Now it just hit her that she's leaving and she's kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off, ok?"
8112,Hi you guys!,What did I just say?
8113,"I know, she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled. I mean... oh, forget it. I miss Melrose Place!","You know, I had a chance to stop her too!"
8114,Yeah?,"Who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row? Head she wins, tails I lose. Wait a minute..."
8115,"Yes, Joe?",I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning!
8116,"Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?","Huh, if I had to guess I'd say Rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and Phoebe is doing the punching."
8117,Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.,I really made you think about that thing uh?
8118,What? I don't get a goodbye?,Lucky bastard!
8119,"Well, it needs to be plicit.","All right, let's think about this. I mean, there's got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?"
8120,I hope Ross isn't too upset.,I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am.
8121,Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.,"Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea."
8122,"Okay, we're gonna start in the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?",Yeah.
8123,Oh my God! Let me see.,Who's that dirty old lady?
8124,Hey!,"Come on here, have a seat."
8125,"Oh... Yes, I'm sure. Oh honey, let's go. Okay bye everyone.","Chandler, wait, wait, wait..."
8126,What?,"If you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger."
8127,,A little more.
8128,Okay.,"A little more, a little more. A little more... All right. Okay, all right, let's do this."
8129,"All right, ready?","Yeah. All right, now give me your best shot."
8130,"All right, here it goes...",Doesn't work...
8131,Morning.,Hey!
8132,What's that?,It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler.
8133,It's a baby chick and duck!,Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.
8134,I did not see that coming.,"Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house, you know? It has that big backyard. And then, when they get old, they can go to that special farm that Chandler took the other chick and duck to."
8135,Yes.,Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there.
8136,What?,"Yeah, Erica went into labor last night. Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now!"
8137,Is Rachel here?,"Uh, I think she's still asleep. Hey, hey, how did it go with you guys last night? She seemed pretty pissed at you."
8138,"Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell, but I'm also not one to have sex and shut up. We totally did it!",Oh my God. You and Rachel?
8139,"I know, it's pretty great.",So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together?
8140,Yay!,"So, so is she still going to Paris?"
8141,Guess we'll never know how it ends.,Okay.
8142,Good.,I bet you did!
8143,Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?,"Sure, yeah. Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?"
8144,And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.,Oh my God! What did you say?
8145,No way!,You can't just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do?
8146,What?,"Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language."
8147,Can't a girl finish a song around here?,Hey!
8148,Okay.,"Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?"
8149,"Alright, you know what? You're right. I should at least tell her how I feel.","Ross, wait!"
8150,What? What?,Could you get me a muffin?
8151,Unbelievable!,"Hey, you know what might help?"
8152,"Hey, what are you working on?","""It's a... It's a """"welcome home"""" sign for the baby."""
8153,"How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?","No, I sat in the paint."
8154,What?,Why not?
8155,"Yeah, and she still wants to go! It's pretty clear where she is.","Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes..."
8156,"Uh, Joe?",Damn it!
8157,"Honey, that's gorgeous!","You know, the baby can't read, Mike!"
8158,"Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here. I can't believe they're not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the baby!","Monica just called from the cab. She said they should be here any minute. And apparently, there's some big surprise."
8159,Hey.,"Hey, so what is the big surprise?"

8162,Yeah.,"Hey, maybe that's for the best."
8163,Yeah?,"Yeah. You know? You just... Look, you gotta... You gotta think about last night the way she does, okay? Maybe, maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye?"
8164,But now she'll never know how he feels!,"Maybe that's okay. You know? Maybe, maybe it is better this way? I mean, now, now you can move on. I mean, you've been trying to for so long, maybe now that you're on different continents.. Right?"
8165,"Maybe that's okay. You know? Maybe, maybe it is better this way? I mean, now, now you can move on. I mean, you've been trying to for so long, maybe now that you're on different continents.. Right?",Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can finally get over her.
8166,"Yeah, that's true. Except I don't wanna get over her.",What?
8167,I don't! I wanna be with her.,Really?
8168,"Yeah, I'm gonna go after her.","Yeah, you are!"
8169,My coat...,This is so cool!
8170,"I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited!","But Ross, Ross. What do you, what do you think she's going to say?"
8171,Hurry!,"Good luck, good luck!"

8174,Alright!,Ah... Chick Jr.? Duck Jr.? Don't hide from mama!
8175,,"Quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack..."
8176,"We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this.","Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift, I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!"
8177,"Oh, great! Just what you want for a new house with infants. Bird feces.","Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone!"
8178,Oh God! What did I just step on?,Oh!
8179,Oh..,You stepped on my egg roll?
8180,"I'm sorry, I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor.",Just put it on a plate and leave.
8181,"Okay, let's find these birds.",Alright.
8182,Alright.,"Wait, wait. Do you hear that?"
8183,"Wait, wait. Do you hear that?",Oh! They're in the table!
8184,"Well, that can't be good!",We gotta get them out of there!
8185,How?,"Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?"
8186,"Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman.","Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little."
8187,"Joey, wait! The ball!",Oh!
8188,Oh!,Oh God! So what do we do?
8189,I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.,Okay.
8190,No... It's all glued together.,Does that mean we have to bust it open?
8191,I don't know. Maybe.,Oh my God!
8192,I know! It's.. It's the foosball table.,"""All right, you know what? We don't have a choice. It's like I would have said in that sci-fi movie if I'd gotten the part. """"Those are our men in there, we have to get them out! Even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life; my time-machine."""""""
8193,Did that movie ever get made?,It did not.
8194,,"Don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of there."
8195,"And we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.",Okay. Here goes.
8196,What's the matter?,I need to say goodbye to the table first.
8197,I understand.,"Okay. Table, you have given us so many great times. And you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel... All of you guys. What can I say? You guys make us look good. You wanna say anything?"
8198,"I don't know. Except that, for one last time... Good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game.","Okay, here we go. I can't do it."
8199,Hey! Did you find them?,"Yeah, they're stuck inside the table!"
8200,That was... Impressive.,"Yeah, you didn't even use the tools for most of it!"
8201,"Sorry about the table, man.",Yeah.
8202,You gonna buy a new one?,Probably not. Nah. I don't know how much I'm gonna wanna play after you go.
8203,"Well, at least we got these little guys out.",Yeah.
8204,"Aww, we were worried about you! Hm. I guess I better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh?",I'm gonna miss these little guys. It was nice having birds around again.
8205,"Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.",What?
8206,"Yeah, I mean we've got a lot going on right now. And, plus, here they'd have their own room.",I could get a goose!
8207,"You know, I - I think you're set with the poultry.","Thanks man. Did you hear that, you guys? You're gonna get to stay here! And, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a reason to come visit."
8208,"I think there may be another reason. So, awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake?","Uh, lame cool guy handshake, yeah."
8209,I know.,"Yeah. Uh, does this mean there's nothing to eat?"
8210,I put three lasagnas in your freezer.,I love you!
8211,I love you!,Hey!
8212,Hey.,So did you guys make it in time?
8213,I know. It seems smaller somehow.,Has it always been purple?
8214,"So, I guess this is it.",Yeah. I guess so.
